Its perfect for after work in the summer time. The staff is always polite and the decore is beautiful, a must place to be!

I have been here on dates, with large groups, with clients and with friends. I always enjoy what I order and out of all of my visits I have never, ever had a bad meal or inadequate service. In fact it has always been quite the opposite. The servers have always been attentive and the general manager nearly always stops by to make sure everything is satisfactory. On my most recent visit I had a longer than normal conversation with him and he seems like he is a genuinely nice guy who takes pride in his restaurant and truly cares about the experience his patrons receive.I have only been going to Brick House for a couple of years and am always surprised when I mention it to people and they think it is another ""breastaurant,"" akin to Hooters or Tilted Kilt. At least for the couple years I have been going, this is no longer the case. The servers all wear shirts that are not overly low-cut and that go all the way down to their pants without a bare midriff. I do think the servers are collectively younger than than a lot of restaurants but they have always been friendly, show enthusiasm for the menu and do a great job!The décor of Brick House Tavern + Tap is very unique. They have many normal booths and tables but also have a few tables with couches as the seats on either side. They have a few large recliners with table inserts that you can sit at that are positioned in front of large TVs. There are easily 50 TVs around the whole dining area that are positioned in a way where you can see many different ones from wherever you sit. However it also seems that they are not too intrusive and allow one to easily ignore them and focus on who they are dining with. In the winter I often try to get a table near their large open fireplace in the center of the dining room! They also have a large patio with multiple TVs and fireplaces on it.I think their food is pretty unique as well. They have some really good appetizers that are plenty large enough to share. Their dinner portions provide plenty of food to where I often find myself bringing part of it home with me. Everything seems to be priced very reasonably too.If you have yet to try Brick House Tavern + Tap I recommend that you add it to your list. If you visited back when it was filled with scantily clad servers maybe visit again now to see the differences. Overall I think it is a fun restaurant with many menu options that should satisfy anyone wanting to eat!"

I went the night the Buckeyes beat the Ducks.  The wings where great - fried crispy.  I tried the caveman and BBQ sauces.  I like the caveman sauce - flavor and kick.  I also have the meatloaf.  It was moist and comes with a mushroom gravy.  You can sample the draft beers.  TVs everywhere!!

Here's my story...Brick House is airy and rustic inside with a wood burning fire pit. We came at lunch and it was not busy. All of us opted for iced tea and we had a round on the table within seconds. The house salads were fresh and crispy...honey mustard dressing a bit sweet for my tastes. With just 2/3rds of a glass of iced tea our server asked if we wanted refills...we brushed him off and kept talking. I ordered the blackened mahi sandwich with fries. My colleagues both had the daily special chicken pot pie. As we waited another full round of iced tea arrived. We muttered our acceptances. The mahi was especially juicy and flavorful. In fact I hadn't had such a good piece of fish in this area. The pot pies were flaky and large, nearly 8 inches across with chunks of chicken breast, potatoes and carrots...this was savory goodness. Another round of iced teas arrived and I finally yielded, excusing myself to the restroom. The fries are seasoned well and plentiful...I felt like we got our monies worth for such a decent fish sandwich. As we prepared to pay the check, yet another round of iced teas arrives....this time in to-go cups! Good god man, apparently they need to get rid of this batch of iced tea!! LolOverall very tasty dishes with good service...will come again and perhaps drink beer next time.

So to the reveiwer who found the sight of the waitresses legs ""gross and disgusting"", it's safe to come back now.    Anyway, the strength of this restaurant is its wide open setup that makes it an excellent place to catch a game.  The large square bar includes a number of craft beers.  As for the food, mine has been mostly mediocre.  The burger was overcooked and the fries ordinary.  Fish was pretty good.  I go back occasionally, especially on game nights."

Not good. The grilled cheese was ok. The pot pie was amazing. I would order that again for sure. Tonight we both got the lamb burgers. They say they have goat cheese on them, but neither of us had any cheese. We informed the waiter who said they actually come with a goat cheese sauce. The menu clearly states goat cheese, not sauce. The deviled eggs were good the first couple times we came, but tonight the filling was really watery and the whites were very rubbery. I'm really disappointed that the quality keeps going down.

We found it by chance and are we glad we did. When you are there ask if Lindsey is working. She was our server and was outstanding. Started with the Potato chips with blue cheese and they were fabulous!  We had the Southern Fried Chicken sandwich, Chicken Fried Benedict, Prosciutto wrapped Meatloaf.  There was NOTHING we could say that would deter anyone from giving this place a try. Too bad this is the only one within a reasonable distance.... Can't wait to go back....

Talked about glory days over beer and burgers with a few pals. Calamari and zucchini fried appetizers were crispy and not overly greasy. Enjoyed the jalapeño and cherry peppers accompanying the calamari. Three of four folks got burgers and one person opted for the wild mushroom pizza. We killed two beer bongs of Thirsty Dog Old Leghumper's porter goodness. My burger was tasty but overdone. Medium rare order was cooked well into medium. Tater tots were a great side. Service was pleasant and attentive. Can't give 4 stars when burgers get overdone. Nice place, good servers and overlooked burgers.

Comfy couches and seats at the bar with lots of t.v.s to watch every game. Not a bad seat in he place. Consistently good food. Highly recommend the Kobe pizza, the garlic tots, meatballs, and the black rum bbq wings. Very good desserts. Bartenders here make great mixed drinks, too.

I've had multiple trips to this place and their saving grace is that the bartenders and wait staff is usually extremely pleasant.  Tonight they were very inattentive and seemed to ignore me for the most part.  There were some ride and obnoxious people at the bar that took a lot of their attention and a motorcycle gang called ""Switchblade Club"" that occupied the outside area.  The kitchen was slow at turning things around.  Also I was sad to learn that the were it of the daily special which was the chicken pot pie.I will go back to this place but am in no hurry."

He got the ribs and I got the mahi and both came out with nice presentation and flavor. This is probably the best/most relaxing sports bar in that area of town.

Tons of TVs with lots of sports...a roaring fireplaces inside and outside...five stars for ambiance. We came here when they first opened and werent impressed...now a few years later, I am a fan. They offer brunch on the weekends with two buck mimosas. The variety is great...def a meat based menu which is perfect for my carnivorous boys. I had the duck hash...I just plain heart duck. My over easy eggs were a little overdone. My son got the special the consisted of pork cop, rib and wings....he loves the sauces and the pork chop was cooked well and not over done. Service is prompt, friendly and efficient. This maybe our new fav brunch spot.

I was pleasantly surprised at the fireplace and couch seating that you don't typically see at similar restaurants.The food was tasty and the service was great. The pretzel appetizer and Philly cheesesteak sandwich were both yummy! Great place to grab a quality meal and watch a sporting event!

It provides for a relaxing atmosphere with good food. Kind of a more upscale sports bar. The staff is friendly. They also hire hot chicks with skimpy clothes to wait on you.

I came for the beer (decent selection, not great), but I was more impressed with the food. I had the Yard Bird sandwich and it was delicious. Place was not crowded (at lunchtime) so I'm wondering where everyone is at?  I would definitely recommend it and I'll be back.

I have it broken down from atmosphere, service and food quality.The atmosphere was really chill and relax. Not only do you have a choice of table, booth but also a couch booth(which we opted for). They have fireplaces going and you're welcomed by the amazing smell of grilled foods. Also they have areas with couches and tv (perfect for you game night folks). The service was spectacular and our waitress Savannah was extremely attentive! She was friendly, quick and intuitive to our next need (filling up waters, condiments and etc).Finally the food was above bar food but not gourmet quality, atleast for my plate. I ordered a bison burger medium rare and I was really disappointed by how over cooked it was. It was pretty much well done, which over all kills the natural flavor. (Pictures attached).The deviled eggs were amazing but too salty, they sprinkle with sea salt and I would recommend going it and maybe drizzling a little syrup or honey to counter act the saltiness of the bacon in the deviled eggs.One of us got the duck wings and he was floored by the quality of the sauce and the Sriracha ranch was INCREDIBLE! We had to ask for more of it to dip in and for myself to cover the over cooked texture of the bison. My sister loved her BBQ bacon burger and said it was amazing.I'm giving it a 4 because I believe maybe my bison was just perhaps an off moment in the kitchen. It's obvious the skill in the cooking from the other plates at our table and the atmosphere makes it all worth the visit.

We were not disappointed! Not only that, we ordered WAY too much food and had to take home lots of leftovers. Even though my son was one of the diners. He eats!  See his review here too (Mark B). We had four appetizers to share. We should have stopped there, it would have been enough. However, we each ordered dinner too. All but one were delicious. I thought the fish 'n chips were bland. I love to ""drown"" the fish in malt vinegar, as I did here. Even then, it didn't have enough flavor. Other than that, definitely a place for some non-standard casual fare. The wait staff was over-the-top friendly as well. Very enjoyable evening."

I met a friend here for lunch and we were promptly seated. Our waitress was really nice and very attentive... drinks always refilled without having to ask and our order was taken quickly. She even gave us drinks in to-go cups after we paid our bill. Nice touch.As for the food... it's so-so. We had some wings for appetizers, kind of small, not that juicy, nor were they spicy. But they came out fast... my guess is that they're warming them up rather than deep frying them.I ordered the grilled Mahi Mahi. The description said it was cooked in a garlicky butter sauce but I couldn't taste it. It was rather bland. I think I picked a meal that was too healthy... it just lacked flavor.The manager stopped by once to make sure everything was ok. The keyword is 'once'! That's a good thing in my book!! There are too many restaurants where the manager stops by 4 or 5 times interrupting your meal / conversation... once is all you need. Plus this guy looked a little scary but he was really nice.I forgot to ask how my friends lunch tasted, but it looked pretty delicious. I wish I ordered what he had (some kind of burger).Overall it's a nice place, great atmosphere... it's probably a fun place to go watch a Browns or Cavs game, have some drinks (good beer selection). I would recommend it if you're in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way to go there.

It has a huge, open-concept dining area with a big fireplace and some tables have couches instead of chairs.I liked the variety of food and drinks they offered. We had fantastic deviled eggs for an appetizer. My boyfriend got duck wings that were tossed in this DELICIOUS sauce... LAWD. UGH! I got a bacon BBQ burger which was really great! And my sister got the bison burger. She didn't like it too much... she asked for medium rare and it came out well. She is also never impressed with anyone's food but her own LOL. One thing they do here that I think is clutch for a good restaurant is they make their own sauces with their personal twist. They had a red pepper aoli and cilantro ranch, both of which were bomb af!The waitress (Savannah) and other staff were super friendly and attentive!I really want to try more of their items, so I'll be back for sure!

It was amazing walking in and being seated at a couch instead of a booth. They asked what sport I'd like to watch and turned on the Indians game for us which was awesome. The food we found good but not great. I ordered the pretzel sticks for an appetizer and the waitress kept trying to take it from our table before we were done. The burgers are huge and tasted great to me but my girlfriend ordered hers with items on the side. The burger came how it is normally prepared and had to ask for her sides 4 times before she got them. I'd go again but I'd be more prepared and specific on my orders.

I liked the different seating options, and would have opted for the couch dinner tables but I was by myself and thought that was a little excessive for just me, but its great to have the options. I had a blackberry collins while waiting for my food and it was delicious! Very good selection of unique drinks and a huge beer list (part of which updates based on the season). I ordered the potato soup which was homemade with huge chunks of potatoes and the ""Steak and Shrooms"" for dinner. My server was very attentive and responsive. I will definitely recommend this place to others in the area."

First, the atmosphere is nice. Second, the waitress was attentive and nice. Third, the food was just ok. I've been on a mission to find a place that serves pizza with a nice, crunchy crust. I thought a pizza made in a brick oven might be just the thing, so I ordered their $10 pepperoni pizza. It was just ok.  I'm a retired teacher, and the pizza reminded me of my school's cafeteria pizza.  The pizza was unevenly heated, and the cheese was a little overwhelming. I'll try the Brick House again, just not for the pizza.

Possibly biased because I'm a Texan (and this is a Texas-based company), but the service here is amazing, the food is pretty darn good, and the environment is awesome.Jessica, my favorite waitress, is quite possibly the best server I've ever come across. It's like she's a freaking genie. I've set down half-empty cups, went back to reach for it again and find a full cup never realizing she had been there. Super attentive and the sweetest personality, she's the main reason I keep coming back again and again.The food is good. A solid 'tavern-style' menu....lots of fried goods, finger foods, and even some decent more traditional entrees (which I honestly didn't expect). The pretzel sticks are a must as well as the sweet and spicy shrimp (deep fried hot peppers anyone?! LOVE them). Huge fan of the deep fried zucchini as well.As far as main meals go, the salads suck. But let's be honest. You don't go to a place like this and order a darn salad. The mahi-mahi is shockingly good. Flaky, sweet, cooked perfectly. Goes great with cajun dusted fries. The burgers are all fantastic with the Black and Bleu being my absolute favorite.I'm really looking forward to trying their ribs and their chicken&waffles on my next couple of trips!"

The food, the friendly staff, the overal ambiance of the place- it's all spot on.  It's a great place to go to grab a bite to eat and/or a drink with friends and just relax.   For the true American man who like to sit on the couch and watch some good old fashioned TV while they eat, they've got TV's everyehere and couches, yes i said that correctly, COUCHES as well as arm chairs with detchable trays. Or if you're just looking for somewhere to bunker down with some friends for a couple hours to watch your favorite teams on a big screen with a few beers then this is the place for you.  They have couches and beer bongs.  Need i say more?For us women out there that might be looking for a little more ambiance than big screens and couches in our dinner plans, they've also got regular tables, booths and outdoor patio seating where you can just sit, chat and take in the awesome food and decor.  They have 2 huge, awesome fireplaces- one in door and one out door that are just beautiful to take in.The sayings on the walls are hilarious so take a second to read them all (my personal favorite is ""I drink to make other people more interesting""  ;-)), there is framed underwear outside the restroom doors (a thong indicating the women's room and boxers indicating the men's room) and just in case that all wasn't great enough- there is a little bit of framed eye candy in the restrooms as well.  Don't worry it's nothing graphic that you would want to hid your childrens eyes from, but just enough to put a smile on your face ;-)  The food is really quite good- kind of like bar fare with a little bit of a high end twist- and it really works.  I've been there 4 or 5 times, have had something different everytime, and have yet to be disappointed.  The drinks are awesome as well.  I highly reccomend the ""Bee's Knees"" if you're into mixed drinks- it's a bit sweet so you'll probably only want to do one or 2 of them but frankly, that's all most people have with dinner anyways so it's perfect. And for those of you that were concerned with the waitress' dress code... that is a non-issue anymore.  They have standard clothes on these days so no need to shy away from coming back.My only 2 complaints would be that I wish they had some more healthy options on the menu.  And once they address that, they should move closer to my house ;-)"

I enjoyed the soft pretzel appetizer, but I would avoid the wings - not good. The entrees were good enough and what I would have expected from this style restaurant. There is also a great beer selection, including many local options on draft.

They were part of their Saturday Special which included a huge pork chop a dish for which they are apparently ""known"", and 1/3 of a rack of ribs.....PLENTY of food, even if you just got done appearing on ""Naked and Afraid.""OK, I promise no more quotation marks.Wings are drum portion only and are fully the size of a chicken leg.Trying them was a major reason for ordering the dish, so I could try them without committing my entire meal to their palatability.Expertly prepared and sauced in a spicy/sweet sauce that complimented them nicely. A definite recommendation for anyone to try.The chop was reasonably tender the marinade was decent enough, haven't gotten chops out much, but these were probably the best I've had.The ribs were OK, but nothing for any self-respecting rib-house to fear.The dish was served with their house sauced white beans which were a decent enough accompaniment, but not especially noteworthy.My wife got their filet Benedict which she praised effusively.Service was quite good, the manager usually checks in during the meal and is quite personable.A notch above the standard sports bar, with great ambiance and plush seating."

It was decorated in a cute way and has very comfortable seating. The menu looked really good, so I chose a grilled chicken sandwich.The chicken was not a fresh grilled breast. It tasted like a frozen, ""pre-grilled"", rubbery chicken breast. I was quite surprised at this, but the whole sandwich was just chewy and spongey. My salad was a little boring.The service was good and our waitress was pleasant. I would probably go back and try something else, but for my first visit, the sandwich did not impress me."

We went because I saw they had pretty great drink specials going on. I love wine and will drink it almost anywhere I go. So, when I saw $6 glasses of wine for happy hour, I was excited. I had 2 glasses plus a small order of food. The food was ok. Nothing to rave about, and nothing I would go back for. I can find better food at better restaurants. But, come time to pay my bill...and I was charged $9.50 for each glass of wine! There was no special happy hour wine list that I had to choose off of and the bartender never said ""oh well you can actually such and such wine for cheaper during happy hour."" Needless to say I wasn't happy about it. I would never pay that much for a glass of wine at this basic kind of restaurant. I would only go back for the happy hour special of $3 craft beers on draft. Don't even bother coming for anything else."

The first time we ordered the butchers board appetizer (AWESOME) and then we both got burgers which were also perfect. The second time we sat outside I got the the chicken pot pie (which I could probably eat every day for the rest of my life) and he got the turkey club which was not only great tasting but awesome presentation. The service was above and beyond both times; greeted by host and seated immediately upon walking in and asked preference  of seating, waiter did a great job of timing everything we got drinks and then the appetizer and then the meals and didn't wait at all OR feel rushed. Great food, great atmosphere, great service :)

We really liked the low-key atmosphere complete with fireplace, a dozen flat screens, recliners and tables that used super-comfy love seats as their booths. It was rather quiet on Sunday evening, and we enjoyed relaxing at our tables -- it kind of make waiting for food easier. Service was just fine, and I appreciated that my waitress made sure to bring me another water when mine was gone, even though she was carrying another table's food in her hands as well. We got the Sweet n Sour Tails for an appetizer and while they reminded us of a similar dish at Red Lobster that we like, they were really nicely done -- not too hot, but the heat could be adjusted by eating the fried jalapenos for those who like it hot. I chose the special of the day, the Mahi Mahi fishsticks with fries and fruit salad. Boyfriend chose the pork chops and mashed potatoes. Everything was really good -- it's one of the few times I've heard my boyfriend say that everything in his meal was good (and we've been together for 9 years, so that's saying something). And I really enjoyed my fishsticks -- they were high quality and yummy. Even the fruit salad had some extra care put into it with strawberries, watermelon, mint and grilled peaches. I'd definitely like to come back here again, and from the looks of their drinks menu, that'll be one of the things that I'd like to try next. :)

There's a new fall food and beverage menu that is out of this world, and my girls and I always enjoy ending our evening sitting around the outdoor firepit sipping cocktails.  I wouldn't have recommended this restaurant to families last year due to the barely there outfits the waitresses USE TO wear.  Luckily management recognized they were alienating an entire demographic and the ladies now dress more appropriately which will allow me to start bringing my kids to enjoy the big screen tv's and indoor fireplace.  All in all this is a great place with great food and great people.

Our friends wanted to sit in a booth, but I would have loved to try out the couch options.  Couches?!  How often do you get to sit in comfiness while eating out?!  Awesome!  They also had a nice patio option with fun decor and a fireplace.When we got the bill, we were pleasantly surprised to learn that craft beers are $3/pint during Happy Hour.  The selection was above average...esp at that price!I had the Turkey Club with tater tots.  It was ok.  Nothing wrong, nothing special.  I was excited to see that it included their signature deviled eggs as I am a deviled egg fan.  Unfortunately, they were not to my liking.  My husband enjoyed his burger.  So, that may be the way to go.I would recommend Brick House.  Definitely try out Happy Hour in the luxury of couches.

When I tell people that I get surprised looks and it's because this place has evidently changed a lot in the last few years and it has been for the better. The atmosphere is great, servers are attentive, the manager has stopped by our table probably 1 in every 5 visits we have had. The food is amazing, really a lot if bang for your buck and the beer selection is extensive. Personal favorites of ours are: meat and cheese board, Greek meatballs, the chips appetizer, stuffed meatballs, duck wings, their new pulled duck pizza, and pork chops! Yum yum yum. And if you're getting dessert the magic brownie is phenomenal!

Saturday night on their outdoor patio was great, had lots of TVs and watched the Indians game. Got the pretzels and the deviled eggs for an app and they were amazing!!! I got the black and blue burger with caramelized onions. They cooked it to a perfect medium and my sweet potato tater tot were extra crispy and came with creamy ranch. Also had the smothered porkchops and a turkey club. Both were amazing and described perfectly on the menu. Our server was Adam and he was very helpful with a menu and seemed to be at our table like every five minutes asking if we were OK. We had a great time and will be back for sure.

Apparently, they could tell it was hurting more than it was helping & they've since dropped that angle in favor of a more homey family friendly bar/eatery. The christmas ale I had was great, our server Lauren was cheery, upbeat, knowledgeable about the menu, and super patient with us as we figured out what we wanted. We got a lot of appetizers & there were so much room for at least one of them to be not-so-good or messed up in some way, but everything we ate was really top notch bar food. The chicken bites were tender & moist & the sauces were great with them. My burger was enormous and was perfectly cooked. The Fish & chips were crispy & savory & the fries were fantastic, not to mention you can get regular fries, cajun fries, or garlic parmesan tater tots. The prices were all also totally reasonable for the portion size & quality. I was really impressed with this place. As far as sports bars go, it's as good as they come, IMO.

I've never been to brick house pre-revamp, but I've heard some horror stories (from women) and I gotta say the new uniforms are better suited to the atmosphere. Covered up women allow the restaurant to do what it's supposed to do: dazzle the fuck out of you. Decor is simple, tasteful and upscale, and the food is amazing. Drink selection is one of the best I've seen. Beer for years, cocktails are mixed right. This isn't applebees though, so your wallet is gonna take a hit. Two cocktails and chops ran me $40. Absolutely. Fucking. Worth it. Stop reading, go there. Now.

At least they are still easy on the eyes (how do they do this?).  Anyway..in my opinion the food is overpriced but decent.  Not gourmet, but decent.  The best thing on the menu is the Yardbird chicken sandwich with tater tots.  Very Good!I do like the atmosphere, patio is nice, as are the fireplaces.  Nice place to take a date.  But the seats at the bar are so worn and rickety, you are constantly wondering when they are going to collapse and make you look like a fool in front of the cute staff!  For the prices they charge, could they at least replace the chairs??Overall, a nice place to hang out with consistent, albeit not exceptional, food.

For the main corse I had the bison burger cooked medium. The burger was cooked very well but not seasoned well. I did not have it with the jalapeño cilantro dressing so that might have been why.

But Brick House is consistently terrible at timing the arrival of appetizers and entrees. This happens all the time! You get your appetizers, then the food shows up before you can take a bite. I hate that. I wanted to give two stars, but some of the food is actually tasty, so they get three.We don't even order our food and appetizers at the same time because of this issue. I guess you have to wait until the appetizers arrive to order entrees if you want to enjoy them.There's some tasty treats here that I recommend - zucchini curls, the breading is really tasty and I like the parmesan cheese on top. However, they ran out of siracha ranch and instead of making more, brought out regular ranch. Huh? Go make more. Which is what they did, when I asked them to please bring the correct dipping sauce.My husband ordered the meatloaf, which sounded interesting. It was very tasty. I would order that on a future visit. I like the French Onion soup - my mom doesn't like that they use smoked provolone, but I thought it was still good and would order again soon.The calamari is a super treat - with large whole pieces, not the little crappy rings you find elsewhere.I ordered the roast chicken - which really was grilled, but a whole half! That's a lot of chicken. I really would have preferred a veggie with this instead of just mashed potatoes. And the potatoes were listed as including cheddar but I had none of that. My husband's potatoes too - maybe they ran out!My parents order the same items every time (pretzel stick appetizer), mahi mahi, and either fish n chips or shrimp (sometimes fries, sometimes tots - I love that they have tots, I am such a fan!).I do not recommend the mac and cheese. It's terrible. They served it to me cold - not hot at all. Then I requested they add a few little bits of jalapeno - I got a boat load of teensy tiny jalapenos - they covered at least a 1/2 inch at the bottom of the bowl. And the bacon was gross - it was too fatty and in huge chunks. This made the entire thing pretty much inedible. Then, they served it to me cold. Yes, not hot, not warm, cool. How did they make it right? They reheated it! Yuck. Now it was dryer than the desert. How did they make it right? They took it off the bill. It still doesn't erase the memories of that disgusting dish.Oh - I know I'll be back because my parents are regular diners there - so it's their go-to place. Plus, compared to nearby restaurants like Olive Garden or Applebees (bleh Chains), this has less crowd and more space. I like the fire. I love the patio. I like the bar. I like the stylish seating areas even though my folks require a table.

70|PfOCPjBrlQAnz__NXj9h_w|ZHbDIkJ9vqklQAVvRwKd2g|hHOsJjdR1R4rzB08Divfvw|Cuyahoga Falls|Brick House Tavern + Tap|-81.4756898|41.1195346|44221|Akron is not a place known for having many restaurants with scantily-clad women serving as waitresses, such as a Hooters.  Such overt sexism is normally reserved for the strip clubs.  Last year, a growing chain named the Brick House opened up what is most like an upscale Hooters on Howe Ave. in the Falls, just a few hundred feet northwest of Chapel Hill Mall.  In day 4 of the Alcoholocaust (what I'm calling my last week in Akron), a friend and I went to visit this place to watch the Tribe game and get drunk.This is a man's place.  If you are a woman, there's a good chance you won't enjoy being here - especially like the guys do.  We came into the place to see girls ranked anywhere from 4-8 on a 1-10 scale dressed in short shorts and shirts exposing part of their stomachs.  My friend and I would intentionally order beers from the lower racks just to see them bend over, but they are only dressing that way to tease you.  They aren't supposed to bend over completely, which is a let down for a lot of guys (I'm here for the game and beer, so it wasn't a biggie).  They have a large number of TVs within the place, as well as a lounge area for the guys to just chillax.  And, of course, there's the average-to-hot waitresses to socialize with.The first thing we noticed (other than the girls) was how much money was shelled into the layout.  The bar had a fireplace, an expensive paint job, upscale lighting, and an all-wooden patio.  No other place would throw in $1 million to make a dining and/or drinking experience this nice.  The next thing we noticed was the beer selection.  The beer selection is impressive for a chain.  They have the shitty domestic beers, but then you work your way up to microbrews such as Thirsty Dog, Hop Devil, and Pilsner Urquell.  They also have an average menu serving food of average quality.  We ordered some wings that were dipped in 4 different sauces and served with celery.  The wings were acceptable, but it was really obvious that they were frozen at one point; they had that formaldehyde-ish taste that Wing Street and The Lube have.  Everything here is quite overpriced, despite the better-than-average selection.  The average price for a beer was $4.50, while the average price for a shot was well over $7.At the end of the night, the Tribe blew a 3-0 lead thanks to the wonderfully predictable pitching of Joe Smith, and we were hammered.  I was even talking about how much I love Yelping (which I never talk about with non-Yelp friends unless they ask).  While I has happy with the girls and the selection, a $20 tab for a Washington Apple, a Hop Devil, a PBR, and wings might be a few bucks more than at other bars I can be found at in Akron.  If you are into an upscale drinking experience and are fine with restaurants that exploit the female body such as this, then this is the place for you.  If not, you are better off staying home.

They have an interesting brunch menu, which essentially gives you a breakfast item and a lunch item (e.g. chicken and waffles). They also have $2 mimosa (I think you have to buy a brunch item though, but odds are that's why you are there if you want a mimosa). The mimosa was good, especially for only $2. The brunch menu was a little pricey, but overall it was pretty good. I'd go again.

They have some cozy couches, recliners and lots of TVs.  Food is reasonable and tasted great.  I just moved here from CA so the waitresses 'outfits' didn't seem hooter-ish to me but I can see now that there was a lot of short-shorts and cleavage for OH maybe.  Will definitely return and recommend it to others!

Plenty of good local beers to choose from along with other varying choices.  It was big and cozy... we sat at two couches with TVs all over the place.  My boyfriend loved it right away.  Definitely a guy's sports place.  We ordered the calamari for appetizer and were pleased.  He loved the drunken center cut pork chops.  He was pleased to see they were bone-in and cooked perfectly.  I ordered my burger medium rare and it came out medium well.  The service was just okay... At one point, it seemed like the whole wait staff had disappeared when we were just trying to get our check.  We would definitely go back to watch a game and have a beer and maybe grab a bite to eat.

I've eaten here at least a half dozen times and the food has always been on point. Servers are great the majority of the time and I absolutely love the couches...because who doesn't want to lounge while they eat?So first I will start off with the brunch service....$2 mimosas anyone? Granted they aren't extremely strong but they are only $2 and still hit the spot! The bloody mary is exceptional as well!As far as happy hour specials, I think it's a fair assumption to say that Brickhouse has the best happy hour specials in the Cuyahoga Falls area. Drinks are cheap and selected apps are half off. Totally worth it!I had my 24th birthday here in 2016 and Brickhouse was fabulous. They had the table ready for my party of 12 as soon as we arrived on a Saturday night. Overall...I can't praise this place enough and I look forward to my next charcuterie board and thai peanut chicken salad!

We had a previous meeting for our upcoming wedding and had 15 min before happy hour ended.  Our waitress was so helpful and suggested the buttermilk chicken bites with 3 dipping sauces and fries.  Dave ordered $3 Blue Moon and I ordered $6 of house Cab. Really good.  For entree  Dave ordered Prociouto wrapped meatloaf and cheddar mashed potatoes.

It was an amazing experiance and I loved every second of it. I made some amazing friends and had a blast everyday at work. The managment was pretty shakey when they first opened. We had like 3 managers within the first 6 months. But our bar manager was AMAZING.The drinks are poured strong, and accurately. The kitchen staff works very hard. And the girls bust their butts.As far as the food goes; COME ONE PEOPLE... Its a bar! Its not a gourmet 5 star restraunt. The burgers arent that good. The Kobe is just ok. The Mahi Mahi is delicious (in the fish sandwich) The philly cheesesteak is sooo good. Make sure you get peppers and onions. Chicken in waffles is good as well. Drunkin pork chops are moist, perfectly cooked, and the sauce is amazing. All of the apps are good. The wings are kind of average ( i am a wing snob )Since I havent been working there I see they have added more items to the menu.Cant wait to go in and check them out.To the women who was like ""omg there was T & A EVERYWHERE!!!""Come on. We were never aloud to have our butts hanging out of our shorts.And yeah ok some girls might have big boobs and heaven forbid are showing some clevage. I just think its so funny how narrow minded people can be.'they must all be hookers!"" Yeah right lady. Every girl likes the outfit, wears it proud with confidence, and busts her ASS on a daily basis. I made soooo much money when I worked there. And no, not because I was showing the world all of my ASSets. But because  I am nice, I work hard, and I am a great waitress.So suck it!Brick House Girls + Brick House Food  rock"

Soooooo good, and a really good portion size for an appetizer. There were 5 wings (which actually looked like legs). They were full sized, too. They looked like chicken legs.I had the lamb burger, which was really good, with the Cajun fries. My friend had the chicken salad with grilled chicken instead of fried chicken. Everything was very tasty, and our waitress, Omorese, was super friendly.

Nice bar, comfy seating inside. However I have just never been wowed by anything on the menu. Their kitchen is open late which is really nice since I work late usually and they give me the option to still enjoy a dinner out. I have tried a decent amount of entrees and appetizers, nothing has ever been great. The soup was cold and smaller than a cup in my opinion. The just menu had just been changed (at least the grilled cheese description) I received a combination of what was on the old menu and new menu on my sandwich. I didn't complain because it was grilled cheese can't really mess that up too bad. BUT the soup was cold. I always ask for my pizza to be well done, it has been made well done ONCE of the 5 times I've asked. I understand that the staffing is based on eye candy I don't mind that, just seems to be a lot of slackers on the job with a few hard workers keeping the machine running. Bar tenders are usually great! Katy and Nancy are always a delight . I'll be back but won't be expecting much!!

The peanut butter had a ton of flavor to it. And the chocolate was terrific too. The hubby had some chocolate and coffee. The coffee could have had a little more flavor but it was good.

The ice cream is out of this world! First impression: the place was empty on a Sunday after church.....surprisingly. The gentleman behind the counter did not seem very friendly. We did not initially realize it was a ""marble slab"" style ice cream place similar to Cold Stone. We told the guy right off we had an Entertainment Book coupon (Maybe why he was stand-offish?) I got peanut butter with chocolate chips added in in a waffle cone. It was the best peanut butter ice cream I have EVER had. And trust me, at 53 I  have had a LOT! The cone was equally impressive: Thick but not hard, very fresh and did not crumble as some waffle cones so easily do! Cost with coupon for two was $4.73  (including a $1 tip). My husband chatted the guy up and apparently he's the owner jointly with his Dad. I highly recommend trying it out I  believe we will go back even without a coupon! The cone is big enough to get one could easily with two spoons. With a portion of friendliness and more advertising this place should be standing room only all summer! We drove from Robinson area to use a Groupon at Bella Fruttetto THEN ice cream here for dessert. BOTH great eats!!!"

The service was good -- not the fastest coffee I've ever gotten -- but my Hawaiian Caramel Salt Iced Latte was excellent. I also ordered a blondie, something my mom used to make for me as a treat, so I was really happy to see that on the menu. I was a little turned off when it came out of a box, but it was pretty comparable to my mom's blondies, so I can't complain. The store was very clean and nicely decorated. A woman commented on the Labrador Granite countertops while I was there, which apparently means something. The shop had a very earthly feel about it. Four or five wooden high top tables made it a nice place to go and get some work done. Free Wifi -- something I feel like should be synonymous with ""coffeeshop."" The highest ticket menu item is a penny shy of $8. There are paninis, sandwiches, salads, etc... so it's really affordable, though I can't attest to the quality of food today, I'll definitely be back.Another big plus for me was the music selection: today's alternative rock with a few throwbacks. My favorite was a blues rock rendition of Kanye & Jamie Foxx's ""Gold Digger.""  Honestly, I'm just trying to figure out how I'm the first person to review this place. There were good people, good vibes, and good coffee. This might be the best kept secret of Houston, Pa."

Yes, this place is old and hasn't been updated in a long long time. That's part of the charm of this old, breakfast diner type place. I'm actually shocked to see people comment on decor and lack of wifi. Are you kidding me? You're here to have a cheap breakfast while supporting a small business that's been around for years. I didn't realize you needed Internet access for that. The sandwiches are amazing. I'm addicted to the bacon and pea meal bacon sandwiches! The only cons I can think of is the wait time can be long during peak hours but again it's a small place and unfortunately that can be the case. Also I find the homefries could be cooked longer! If you're that big of a snob that you need fancy decor and wifi to be happy eating your $8 dollar breakfast....go somewhere else.

Everything looks and tastes OH SO GOOD. My favourite is their waffles with strawberries, whipped cream and bacon, definitely better than cora's waffles in quality and price (sorry to all the cora fanatics out there). Besides the waffles, I would highly recommend their cheese danishes, milkshakes, turkey pies, bagels, cheesecake, grilled cheese, scones, and soup. That's basically all the things I have tried at T&T! The people who work there are always friendly and they bring the food right to your table so just sit down after you order, and get ready to FEAST! :D

As per other yelpers reviews, I can contest that this is a classic diner stuck in the early 80s. The decor is old. Tables and chairs are limited. Very busy, almost always. You have to pre pay for your food and there is no table service. Moving onto the food. It can be hit and miss. I've had great breakfast here, nothing spectacular, as you would expect since it's so cheap. Service is whatever. Again, can't expect much from a place like this. The best thing this place has going is its fresh pastries and pies. They're absolutely delicious and always fresh! 3/5 for me.

It is a family-owned, homey kind of place that is always busy. They have the very best blueberry pancakes and bacon, made fresh, which is my favourite thing to order, but everything on the board is tasty and fresh. They also have daily lunch specials such as pierogies and polish sausage with sauerkraut and pretty good sandwiches as well. A popular item they have is homemade quiche, different ones each day and they are definitely worth trying for lunch. The prices are very reasonable but it gets quite busy at lunchtime and on weekends so finding a table can be difficult, especially with a bigger group. The treats and desserts are also very yummy. They make cookies, squares and tarts and sometimes there is even homemade bread pudding which is de-lish! I most definitely recommend this place. It is also worth mentioning that they do big lunch platters for events if you call ahead.

I've been coming here for over five years now. I am going to say however that there is an undertone of racism emanating in the staff. Maybe it's in my mind but I have noticed they are super friendly to certain people that are regulars and I would consider myself a regular. They know them by name and greet them. Now that being said, they have never been rude or unprofessional in my dealings with me. Until my dealings are any different, I'll continue to frequent this bakery. I'm sorry if some feel I'm out of line with my comments, I'm just being honest.

A really nice family owned/operated shop that specializes in breakfast. I've walked 30+ minutes to get to this place because I was craving their baked goods. Everyone in my family loves this place. On a sad note.. I heard one of the owners recently passed away. I know it really shook a lot of the regular customers, and of course her family. I just hope they continue to keep this business in the family, because they truly make T&T what it is.

The first time was over 2 yrs ago.Friendly staff, Good prices for their breakfast specials - I had scrambled eggs with (3)bacon and potatoes and toast - which was priced under $7.Strange that coffee refill is (81 cents as i recall)I gave this breakfast experience 2.5 stars because i suggested having breakfast here to my sister whom was visiting from Ottawa.  Everything was good, up to paying for the food - Its cash only !! So i had to borrow $$ from my sister.  Then when we sat down, there was 6 of us, we waited.... and waited... and waited.. I know that restaurants like to bring the table all the meals at once, but we didnt order anything out of the ordinary.. We ordered the french toast special and the eggs/bacon special.  I believe it took..over 25 mins. And my sister pointed out that people that came after us were getting their food first.Bacon was salty and you can see the grease on it. Everything else was fine.Table was a bit sticky.I think the wait time killed this experience. Go as a couple!!Let's see what happens next time. :)

T & T is not about being upscale or trendy, at ALL. It's a family-run place with outdated decor and basic, fresh food which is almost always delicious and is consistent. Yummy breakfasts and sandwiches, delicious quiche and salad combo every day (I don't know how they keep their salad so fresh!), and many delish desserts, some of which are made in house. They do take out and also pre-orders for parties and such. Because it has become a mainstay for those who are regulars, it is ALWAYS busy, but we seem to get a table even so. Sometimes the family and employees are a little harangued but it's always a good meal. Don't have crazy high expectations...just relax and enjoy watching the streams of people coming and going. :)NOTE: CASH ONLY

My parents used to take me here as a child, and I have continued to go back on a regular basis whenever I am back in town from school. While the staff can be a little impatient, the service is great overall, and the food is fantastic. Their homemade pies and soups are my favourite things to order. Everything is homemade from scratch (from what I know) and you can really tell. Plus, the prices are fantastic for what you get!I recommend this place to everyone. It is definitely worth a visit (and a billion more).

I was hoping we could all sit together but given the fact the place was very busy we couldn't.   The place is quite quaint and has a very small town homey feel to it.  It's a cash only place (which I don't like) and you have to go the cash first, order your breakfast that's indicated on a chalk board and pay before receiving your breakfast.  I ordered the #1, poached eggs, bacon, beans, toast and home fries with a Tea,  $9.65There are some cons to not having table service other than having them bring you your breakfast.  If you need some water or you are missing utensils or need more napkins you will need to catch them while they bring your food to the table or you will have to trek over to the counter and interrupt the busy staff. However; when I did ask to have our table wiped before eating (since the table was not cleared from the previous customers) they did so promptly.  I saw a staff member handwashing dishes and cups at the counter.  I don't like the fact that the dishes are handwashed instead of using a dishwasher that washes and sterilizes but I guess they like to keep it old school. While waiting for our breakfast (tick tock) the power in the kitchen went out and the cook came out using profanities drawing minor attention from customers.  I'm sure he was frustrated, but somehow worked his magic because before I knew it, my breakfast was before me.  Any preconceived notions I had about the breakfast place we're soon forgotten.  Presentation lacked a little but the taste and quality of the food more than made up for any short comings up to that point.  The whites of the 2 poached eggs were a little runny, however; the 3 slices of  bacon was cooked to perfection and the baked beans were heavenly.   I was never a fan of homefries,   but these were lightly seasoned grill fried and delicious.   I am a very critical person especially when it comes to food and service and they passed with flying colours.  The atmosphere is a little hectic (at least when I was there) and I would not recommend this place if you are coming with a large group (5 or more), with that said....This is probably one of the most enjoyable breakfasts I've had.

My daughter and I eat here all the time and I always bring friends. Portions are very generous. We need more home cooked food like this in Markham and less chain restaurants.

Did not read the other reviews prior to my visit so was pleasantly surprised how comforting this place was at first glance.The place was more than 50% packed on a Sunday late morning.The menu seemed equally comforting.  I looked around and saw most eating breakfast plates:  eggs, bacon, toast, home fries...typical breakfast items.   The other popular dish seemed to be their in-house baked bagel sandwich with bacon.We decided to try their waffles with strawberries and an item from their lunch menu (which is offered for breakfast times too!), a chicken pie with salad.  Both were tasty and a nice portion for brunch.I give 3.5 stars for the food but what I cannot stand are flies so the experience made it short of a 4 star experience.Very friendly and accommodating staff.

The tuna sandwich actually was the best item we ordered. It tasted fresh and they didn't skimp on the tuna. I didn't ask but it tasted homemade. The soup was full of flavor and wasn't too salty. The weakest item was the turkey pie which tasted sightly sour. I should've went with my gut and got the beef pie which I expect would've tasted better.As good as the food was, the winner was the service i got at such a small shop. Servers were attentive and provided service with a smile. I noticed a few of the customers seem to know the servers by name. Would come back for weekend brunch for sure.

I officially found a place that is stuck in the 80's.  Maybe some 70's. If classic food is your fix you have to come here.  Everything is made fresh to order and or was made that day. Breads, buns, burgers and all. The portions are huge and will take you out for the day. Coffee is a classic boiler which I won't talk about.  I had the Handmade burger which was huge and nice, but this is no gourmet burger. Think 70's diner burgers that are simple and had your classic toppings.  The home fries are a classic made plate of joy. The bread Pudding is most likely a way they use day old bread and it is perfect in its simplicity. No too sweet and no nuts or added things. The hot items are the meat pies, schnitzel, and some of the other European favourites.  I'm assuming they are Polish or German background family. Some of the cakes are not made there so stick with the pastries and pies which all look like they are made like they should.  The big surprise to me was Cash Only. So bring your cash. No debit, no visa, nothing. So I actually had to go down the street to the atm to get money. I will definitely come back to try some of the other house specials. Great job keeping a place alive.

The owner Sebastien took over from his parents and continues with the delicious home style food. The decor hasn't changed in decades. Some call it dated, but it's part of the charm for long time customers. Sebastien catered our Markham Kiwanis Club meetings for years. Since the club wound up, he continues to provide delicious food for our Christmas reunions. The desserts, especially the butter tarts and chocolate eclairs are out of this world. If you're looking for wifi or the latest fashions, you can always go somewhere else, but for good food and friendly service in the old Town of Markham, T&T is my choice.

I've had pretty much every item on the breakfast menu over the years and all great. Fresh cooked and delivered to your table. At T&T you order at the front counter and than find a table. During the week, this can be an easy task, on weekends, look out, get there early, there is a lot of turn away business. It appears to be run by a family who takes their work very seriously. The other thing I like is, they have no problems with custom orders. They have a menu on the wall for breakfast with about 6 items, if you don't see an item you like, just ask, and there will be no problem. The only minor issue is I don't like the coffee, it could be a bit richer and perhaps stronger, but this is minor. If you are in the mood for some fresh baked goods for breakfast or a good ole diner style breakfast, then T&T is the place for you.... make sure you try the bacon, its not the usual out of the plastic bag bacon, they must get is custom from somewhere.....Enjoy!

It is a local favourite and gets PACKED. Parking is brutal (try the back) and if you get here after 12:30 pm for lunch, expect a 15-20 minute wait in line, plus 15-20 minutes for food. That's right - possibly forty minutes wait time for your food...And yet the lines have stayed long all these years because they've got some pretty good stuff. They preach quality over quantity (one meal doesn't come close to filling me) and make everything on the spot.They have breakfast and lunch specials on a whiteboard on the right hand side when you walk in through the main doors. The full menu hangs from the top and consists of all their pastries and baked goods.Chicken cutlet: crunchy and evenly breaded, and tender!Home fries: they're okay - clearly rushed when cutting and seasoning. They're basically diced potatoes that are unevenly but heavily seasoned.Home burger: delicious.Beef pie: ... disappointing. It fell apart quite easily and I like my crusts a bit sturdier!Breakfast: solid - they have a number of different specials, and I got their bacon one (comes with two eggs and home fries). Their bacon is a tad over-crispy although very limited in quantity (I think I had five strips...?) and they make their over-medium eggs slightly too well (but I'm notoriously picky when it comes to judging over-medium eggs)I heard their quiche is good but haven't tried it yet!Ultimately, I think it's a pretty good spot, but the line up does detract from it, and the portion sizes are not always worth that 30+ minute wait... Come early if you do!

I only visited recently because I moved in the area. The food was really good - I got the bagel BLT which was really really good. The bagel was similar to a twister bagel you'd get at other places. They were also not cheap on bacon (which is always a good thing). My husband got the breakfast with poached eggs and was very satisfied. The service was good. What others said in the reviews is true - you have to get used to the idea of self service (ie picking up your own utensils, butter, etc). Also, you have to get up and pay for coffee refills. Also note, It's CASH ONLY. My only improvement point on this place is the cleanliness and decor. It's very old and outdated. I mention the cleanliness because I did notice maybe 4 black flies on the wall near where I was sitting :S.

However, my mind drew a blank, and feel like Greek Salads are hard to come by in uptown.  With that said, I thought I'd give Shomars a try, being that it was close, and I have the chicken pita before and liked. So, I ordered the Greek Salad with chicken and a side pf pita bread.  The chicken was cooked to perfection and the salad was good, very large too.  However, I found the dressing to be a little oily than what I prefer, but will definitely go back for the chicken pita again, love the tzatiki sauce!

They have more inventory stocked so they're no longer saying they're out of this or that. The place is also much cleaner and fresh looking. Their gyro is why you want to visit. It is very tasty and is a hearty portion. The Taziki sauce is very good too. They also make a great gyro salad, especially with salmon added. It comes with puta bread and Taziki sauce. This Shomars is a great choice for government employees to eat at on their lunch break. They offer a 10% discount for them every Tuesday.

While down here for a conference, my coworker who was local convinced me I had to try the fish sandwich...and get one to take on the plane too. While the crinkle cut fries are uber tasty, they're not the most amazing thing I've ever had. The mac and cheese was a good call (more on the gooey side) and the fish, while messy, was simply astounding. All for approx $10 too. plus they're a local Charlotte family chain, which I absolutely adore. Service was prompt. The only thing is that they close at 3pm. If I ever get to come back to Charlotte, I'll pick up some Showmars!

The Showmars at the Government Center pretty much has a captive market due to it's location and lack of restaurants surrounding.  I came during an off lunch time, but you can see the remains of the lunch crowd that pretty much destroys the restaurant (figuratively speaking).  You walk in, and there is a sign that explicitly says to form 3 lines and the cashiers will call you went its your turn.If you are walking to the building, you will have to go through metal detectors since the building is a secure location.  It's a little strange to feel like you need to go through security just to go to a restaurant, but hey, I get it.Typical Showmars menu here...   items are made to order and are quickly to you after they give you a number tent and you find a table.  Since I came after the lunch rush the staff had closed of some table sections to clean, it was a little awkward when you got ""fenced in"" but easy enough to move a chair to go get a drink refill."

It reminds me of NYC restaurants in West Village. It's a little small (maybe around 12 or 15 tables?), but not crammed. Dark wood and tons of framed pictures and posters make a very intimate setting for small gatherings and good conversations. Brunch menu is pretty standard, but the quality of food is amazing. I got a Veggie and blue cheese wrap and it was HEAVENLY! Friends got a egg benedict and egg florentine and those were amazing too. The atmosphere was really chill, we sat there for 2 hours and no one rushed us to get the check or anything like that. It was very relaxing and comfortable.Minus one star for the slightly slow service. They were a little understaffed for a full house. Staff were all very nice and professional though. Will definitely go back for lunch/ dinner again!!

Well, maybe I didn't cross it specifically to be my #100, but I'm in Toronto and it happened to be my #100. Now, I was worried that my excitement regarding this restaurant may have been biased. I was REALLY excited that this place was going to be the big triple digit review. However, this place was pretty fantastic. The ambiance here is great. Just enough tables to feel like it could be crowded, but not too many to were it loses its intimacy. Great long padded bench with tables spread out along it and some individual tables  as well. A cute little outside area (but only 2 person tables can fit...it is teany tiny!). Nice well decor, lighting, music. Cute bar with tons of wine options (or at least enough to make me happy). Food was pretty great too. The bread was hot and toasted just right and served with olive oil and balsamic. My pasta with sausage was great and my friend enjoyed her mussels. However, it was the frites that came along with the mussels that were pretty damn delicious. Great salty flavor with what seemed like a hint of parmesan and spice. Finish off with a perfect sized tiramisu and you'll be pleasantly satisfied. My sangria was great, but I don't claim to be a sangria expert (one of my favorite sangria's is made with Mad Dog 20-20...I love Dominik's!). Very fruity and I loved it. A couple of fun facts: All you can eat mussels Mon-Thu; They have a second location apparently but I have no clue where it is; It's been around for about 8 years (per our waiter, who was very nice) and is a local favorite; packed on weekends and they don't take reservations between 7pm-8pm on weekends; they also have a prix fixe menu for $25 (appetizer, main course, and dessert) .Honestly, this place would be great for a casual dinner with friends or even for a date. I really enjoyed it and the food was faboo (yahoo!)Happy #100 Yelp!

At the end of our meal we were surprised when they took care of our entire bill (all $110 of it!) We also identified ourselves when we made our reservations so they knew it was us from the start.I think it is extremely commendable that the restaurant offered to make up for a previous experience. Most just wouldn't care.With that disclaimer in mind: The service during this visit was impeccable. Despite the fact the restaurant was packed when we arrived we were greeted and seated right away. Throughout the evening we always felt like the most important guests in the restaurant with our food arriving quickly and our servers being careful to make sure we had everything we needed. The food is very simple and elegant. The ingredients are fresh. The menu is everything you'd expect from a nice Italian restaurant. My only advice would be to skip the Caesar salad, the other salads on the menu are much better.While we ate our meal we watched Mariam, the owner, making the rounds of the restaurant making sure every table was happy with their experience. She is clearly passionate about what she does and has a real heart for her customers and her business. We couldn't help but overhear a truly genuine conversation between the couple next to us celebrating their 50th anniversary and Mariam. They were telling her how Alize is their favourite restaurant in the area. I'm giving this an honest 3 star review because for me, this isn't my ideal restaurant. I like restaurants that are a little darker, a little noisier, and foods that are a little more off beat and provide a 'wow' factor. This place will be lovely in the summer on the patio or even inside since they can open the front right up to let the warm summer breeze blow through.Alize, thank you for a wonderful evening.

We started off with fresh squeezed orange juice and some coffee.  Service was great and it wasn't crowded.I had the eggs benedict.  I've never had them with mushrooms before.  It was great.  They did forget to put my holandaise sauce on the side (I must have offended the chef for asking) but I managed to scrape it off.  The potatoes and salad that came with it were also great.A great spot for brunch.

When I entered the restaurant, the server knew right away that I was the one that made the reservation and quickly sat us.The waiters and waitress was absolutely awesome.  They quickly brought us water and told us about the specials that they had that day.  I ordered the seafood fettucine and my frien had the prix-fixe menu (salad, 8 oz. steak, and chocolate cake for $25).  The fettucine was superb: surprisingly quite a lot of seafood and sauce in the noodles.  I also ordered a white chocolate, blueberry strudel for dessert.  I enjoyed how the tangy taste of the bluberries compimented the white chocolate; however, sometimes, the white chocolate overpowered the blueberries and got a tad too sweet.Ambiance was great.  Small little restaurant, but I loved it.  Wasn't really feeling for an eclectic, large restaurant; so this was absolutely perfect.Overall though, great experience at Alize.  Will defintiely come back again!

The menu was as follows:2 x Onion Soup and Crispy Parmesan Gratin2 x Grilled Shrimp and Calamari in a Provencal sauce2 x Atlantic Salmon on Linguine2 x Duck Confit with Wild-Mushroom RisottoDessert platter for the tableCoffee/TeaThere were a total of 6 of us, and the other 2 ordered off their weekly Prix Fixe menu for $25 which includes an appetizer and entrée.  All items marked with an asterix on the menu were available options.From the dinner prix fixe menu, we opted for the onion soup, and the organic greens.  For mains, the Beef Bourgignon and 8 oz. New York Striploin were selected.We also ordered 2 glasses of wine, a Merlot and a Cabernet Sauvignon.  I am not a fan of red wines to begin with, but I found the Cabernet to be too sour for my taste buds.  The Merlot was much more subtle.Upon ordering, we were brought 2 warm bread baskets.  Those of you who know me know how excited I get when I am served warm bread, or how bratty I get when I am served cold bread :p  It was a poppy seed bread served with balsamic vinaigrette and olive oil.  From what I gather, it is a store-bought bread and not bought daily as the bread, though I won't say stale was not the freshest. The French Onion Soup was disappointing to say the least.  The lack of deep onion flavour and gooey cheese coupled with a little too much wine in the broth made for a rather sour taste.  More cheese and more onions = more flavour.  The math is quite easy folks!  The only part of this dish that was tasty was the crostini. The Grilled Shrimp and Calamari in a Provencal sauce was served almost cold which was indicative that it had been waiting for awhile since the chef prepared it to reach our table.  The calamari was nicely grilled, soft and tender but unfortunately the shrimp were overcooked.  The salad came adorned with olives and a balsamic drizzle.  Overall, this dish was all one flavour - tart, mostly stemming from vinaigrette and tomatoes.  It would've been nice for some contrast.The Salmon Linguine was made with a simple sauce which really brought out the flavour of the fish.  The salmon for me was the best part as the skin was crispy and the fish was flaky.  The linguine was rather bland, with a lemon-oil drizzle.  So you can imagine how excited I was when the server brought over the Parmesan cheese for sprinkling!The Duck Confit came with your choice of sauce: veal jus, orange jus, or blueberry jus. We opted for the veal and orange jus.  The duck had a nice crisp skin, but it was more of a crust than anything else.  It resembled the texture of a chicken wing that's been sitting on the grill a little too long.  The risotto was barely warm and a bit dry.  The side vegetables were tender and savoury.I also got to sample both the sirloin and the beef bourgignon.  The steak was quite flavourful and had a nice charred flavour to it.  Taste was all there, but texturally, it was a tad on the dry side.  The frites were amazing!  I love crispy fries.  Ketchup wasn't even on my mind when I was chowing these down.  That must be a sure sign that they were tasty?  I found the red wine in the beef bourgignon to be overpowering, but my mom thought it was fine.  My only ""beef"" about this dish is that I wish the meat were more tender.The Groupon specified that a dessert tray would be served. The serving size was more suitable for a party of 2 than it was for a party of 4.  It consisted of a Crème Brûlée, Blueberry Strudel and Raspberry Sorbet with blueberries, gooseberries and raspberries for garnish.  I was unimpressed with their  crème brûlée which was grainy and not velvety smooth.  The raspberry sorbet was quite refreshing.  The strudel was more what I would call a dessert spring roll and had a crisp exterior and yummy filling!  The house coffee was also quite good.  My parents, who you have never applauded any restaurant for good coffee finally cracked and awarded their first ever java compliment.Verdict:I haven't experienced service like this in a very long time.  The servers were very attentive, courteous and sported a smile.  Food-wise I was a little disappointed but it wasn't terrible.  It someone were to ask for recommendations, Alizé wouldn't be on the top of the list but if I were in the area I may eat here again... Perhaps ordering off their regular menu would serve as a better basis of comparison.  Until then, I reserve judgment."

I first came across Alize a few years ago, when I went there for dinner. The wait staff was not so good, especially for such a small, I guess you could call it cozy restaurant. The menu selection was about what you would expect from a restaurant this size. When the food got to the table it was flavorful and I was satisfied with the overall quality. Now with all that being said, I went back a few weeks later for their Brunch, which I have to say was FANTASTIC! selection was good and the service was better then what I had experienced last time I ate at Alize.Hope that helps

Tiramisu is always my bday cake so I know a good one when I have it. I decided to try this place this year and I have to say even T&T's grocery store cakes are better than it.

One of Maxim's most popular cakes is definitely the meringue (mango/strawberry); they are quite pricey ($32 for an 8"") but are delicious...Two of crunchy meringue (with almonds) and fresh whipped cream in between.They offer a wide variety of choices for cakes and have always been fresh (black forest, mango mousse, cheesecake/green tea cheesecake, white chocolate  cake, mango yogurt, mocha, many more!).The one time I had lunch here it was very quiet. The lunch specials are more pricey than your normal westernized HK cafes (ie. Firefly) as they can be up to $13-20 for a combo...although it comes with soup, main, beverage and a slice of cake. The food itself isn't bad, but my main complaint is the pathetic size of the cake of choice... it is literally 1/2 of a normal slice..honestly I don't think it would hurt to give a full slice.. you'd win people like me over who have a sweet tooth :3.Additionally, my other complaint would be that they charge $0.50 for a small chocolate badge if you want writing on certain cakes (i.e. the meringue). The service at the cake counter can be quite lacking although there are plenty of staff chilling behind the counter.They accept credit card for transactions over $30."

I've had it so many times! One of the best! So fluffy, light, and it melts in your mouth. The tart was delicious too. The chestnut cake wasn't worth it. It cost $4.50 and it only had one layer of chestnut and the meringue topping wasn't fresh. Definitely stick with the meringue tart and meringue cakes. A tip - order it the day before because I wanted to buy a cake, but it was sold out.

They were all delicious and each dish was nicely presented.  The cream of broccoli soup was to die for and when it came to dessert time I wanted them all!  The price also includes coffee or tea, what a deal!! I enjoyed the decorations and it's atmosphere, reminded me a lot of fond memories of Hong Kong.  Wished I live closer!!!Veronica Berlin

Was pleasantly surprised with the food and the service.Knew that Maxim did mostly desserts and cakes, but the dinner was pretty good. We ordered off the dinner special menu, so we got soup, coffee/tea, and a slice of cake with the meal. I had Curry Lamb Shank with Wild Rice, which was very good. Rice was quite nice with a pretty soft lamb. The Seafood Paella was okay as well.Cakes were quite nice, but ended up really full, so didn't finish it. We had the Tiramisu, Meringue, and Orange Chocolate Cake.Service was quite good, as they were very nice. Came by often to see if we needed anything, and quite friendly!

Both times I was equally satisfied with the service and food. Water was filled without you having to ask and there were enough waiters to serve everyone. I would classify Maxim as a more upscale HK style cafe because they have a lot of the dishes typically served in a regular HK style cafe. The two basic choices between cream and Russian borscht soup also makes me feel this way. There is plenty of variety on the menu like sandwiches, soups, salads, burgers, pasta, curry, rice, steak, lamb and, of course, cakes as they are a bakery. They have regular lunch combos if you want to be frugal, or you can spice things up with more expensive lunch or dinner specials with the choice of salad or lobster bisque as an appetizer and a slice of cake as dessert. For lunch I ordered some smoked salmon with shrimp pasta which was one of the lunch specials of the day with Russian borscht soup. The free bread they give you with the soup is not good at all. Very tasteless and cold. The actual soup itself was pretty good and I preferred it over the cream soup I also tried. The portion of the pasta was about average and the sauce used was not very good. However, I was able to eat the food from what my party ordered because their portions were much bigger. I really liked their Caesar salad and mashed potatoes. The deluxe club sandwich was really big and unfortunately, it was a hassle to eat because bits of tuna kept falling out. The Black Forest cake they picked out for me to eat was not to my liking, but that's only because I prefer more sweet cakes.For dinner I ordered lamb chop with lobster bisque. The soup was made in a HK style which meant the lobster flavour was much more mild than if you were to have it at a typical western restaurant. The lamb was good quality and there was minimal amount of salt, pepper and seasoning which is what I prefer because you get a more clearer taste of the lamb. Others might find it too devoid of seasoning. Maybe it was because the restaurant was almost closing and they had to get rid of their cakes, but they let me choose what type of cake I could have for dessert this time. During my previous lunch visit, I was told there would be an extra $2 charge if I wanted to pick the cake out myself. I chose the mango cheesecake which was not very sweet again, but I guess that ends up being healthier.All in all, this place has existed for a very long time (25+ years?) for a good reason. You might have to wait for a table on weekends. I would recommend Maxim for lunch and dinner and not for the cakes.

I ordered the roasted lamb and was disappointed that is was not seasoned enough. After two bites, I pushed away my meal and sampled my friend's orders. It takes a very dull meal to stop me from at least attempting to eat it.From what I tasted, one out of the four orders was appetizing.Now on to the cakes. The cakes were very good. I would almost wish this restaurant specialized in cakes and desserts. That or bring up the standard of the meal to that of the cakes.

The lunch or afternoon tea is better than the dinner. They give hot water instead of ice water to customers and that is the part I like. If they can make better milk tea or coffees, I will give them five stars.

The food was hot and served relatively quick despite it being very busy that day with only 2 servers. The food was tasty, and filling. The price is very very good. The meal came with a slice of cake of your choosing afterward, from their large selection of cakes. Very pleasant little bistro in Richmond Hill.

I love its flavour and textures combined and love that its too sweet or hard. The price is decent and I go out of my way to get the cake because you cant get it anywhere else to my knowledge. Be careful if you are ordering any of the other cakes as many include rum inside as an ingredient.

So we got the lunch specials which was around 10 to 14 dollars. Each came with bread and soup. The bread appeared to be home made and was extremely good. Crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The soup wasn't hot however, it was slightly warm.The meal itself was alright. I got the black pepper chicken and the chicken was tender AF HOLLLLLY. IT WAS GOOD. came with a salad and 2 spring roles. Hostess gave us free cake which was also amazing!Would come again!

It's a good value meal; with soup, entree, dessert and coffee/tea all around the mid $20s range. I would want to come back for their weekday lunch deals at $14.95 which include appetizer, main course, a piece of cake, and coffee/tea. Weekends are $1 more. Nice service, spacious, and clean. The best part is it's one of the rare Chinese run restaurants that are not noisy. :p

When first stepped into the restaurant, it does not have too many people.  But not an hour later it is filled and packed.  The service is all you can say like a fast food restaurant.  The server expects you to know what to order if it is your turn.  Be quick and precise, not to hesitate.  The food though maintains its standard.  Each of the different dishes that our group has tried has a good comment.  The club sandwich is large and thick, enough to fill up any person together with fries.  The ox tail rice unexpectedly the ox tail is cut into very thick pieces so it looks piling up on the rice.  The ox tail is very well cooked and tender but the tip you can still taste a bit of the raw tail - can be done better.  The chicken comes with a salad and rice and the portion is large.  The Borsch is tasty and a bit too much tomato paste.  Most of the sauces are really thick and can fill your stomach really fast.The lunch serving is very slow, may be due to the number of customers.

The 8"" cake is $32 and the 6"" is around $22-$24. They have a large selection of cakes ranging from Tiramisu, Cheesecakes, Meringues, Fruit Cakes to Strawberry Shortcakes! Usually we get their green tea or New York Cheesecakes, and you can never go wrong with them, the Cheesecakes are always delicious and never too heavy.On our latest visit to this location, my family really wanted to the 8"" mango meringue cake but unfortunately we didn't pre order it, so the one on display had been served to customers by the piece. Thankfully, there was also a strawberry meringue that was being served by the piece too and the owner was nice enough to combine what was left of the two into one whole cake! The meringue was amazing, I don't think there's anywhere else where you can get a meringue of this quality, it was nice and fluffy as well as very flavourful. This is a great cake place!"

I had dinner here once and it was okay.  It is more pricey than other Chinese restaurants.  I usually just come here when I have a sweet tooth - They have a good selection of cakes.  I tried most of their cakes - Cheesecake, Mango cake, Chocolate Grand Marnier and Strawberry meringue are my favorite.  It is around $4.50 a slice of cake but the portion is not that big.  8"" meringue cake cost around $28 plus tax which is a little expensive."

It is an upscale casual bistro that happens to be run by Chinese.  And with this arrangement, Maxim offers exceptional value when compared to other casual fine dining establishments.  Upon entry, I noticed the dim lighting, the white clothed tables, the pleasant and tasteful decoration and, you can't miss it, a wide selection of cakes in a refrigerated display case.We ordered from the set dinner menu a Pickled Pork Hock with Sauerkraut and Potato ($19) and a Maxim's Mixed Grills ($22). Both came with roll and butter, starter soup, a piece of cake of your choice and a hot beverage. The Pork Hock was well portioned.  It was the size of a baseball (see pic). The flavour was bold, though not as complicated as the authentic pork hock at The Muskets. The meat was very juicy. The flavour was unfortunately one dimensional, but the tenderness and the juiciness of the meat made up for it. The Mixed Grills had a mix of steak, pork, sausage, and lamp chops (see pic). My BF said they chops were all tender and flavourful, though maybe salty for some. The cut of the meat was good.I eagerly awaited the dessert because the cakes looked so pretty in the refrigerated display case.  There were maybe 10 types to choose from.  Patrons were expected to choose by viewing the case and ordered it through a wait staff back at table.  My BF chose a slice of Cappuccino Meringue and I chose a slice of Blueberry Almond Meringue.  I must say the Cappuccino Meringue was the better of the two.  Is Maxim good? Yes, food tastes decent.  Is Maxim a good deal?  Oh 200% yes, if you order from the set menu.  The regular menu is rather pricey.  Is Maxim French?  I am not sure.  It tastes more continental to me.  The service was efficient and sufficient, yet definitely not refine by the standard of a casual fine dining restaurant.Maxim is a solid choice if I feel like enjoying a Western meal in class but don't want to hurt my wallet too much.

They bake a lot of cheese  cakes: lemon, NY, Mango, Mocha, Mixed Fruit, Green Tea, Chocolate Grand Marnier, and Strawberry.The also have the standards: Saint Honore, Viennese Chocolate, Chestnut Cake (layered with imported chestnut puree), and a slew of differently flavoured meringue cakes.This is the place to take your date or significant other for some deep soulful looks, as you contemplate the universe, or more prosaically, the next few hours to come. Just like Soma, (no sexism intended), it is more a 'chick's place' than a man's. I tried to propose there, it's that kind of place.But if you have a sweet tooth give them a whirl. I am partial to the fruit flan and the hazelnut chocolate mousse."

The coffee was delicious and good quality. Staff is very friendly and It's located in a great place.The reason why I give only 3 stars is because the chairs inside are very uncomfortable.  They are wooden bar stools and I couldn't be seated on it for more than 3 minutes. Its not a relaxing coffee experience at all if you sit on one of their wooden stools. You could probably get more comfortable on a toilet seat than these stools for a cup of coffee. Everything else is fine.

The service was fast enough and everything was fresh as usual.   It just doesn't deserve 5 stars as the staff here don't add the personal touch like some other Starbucks do.

The counter attendant asked if I wanted a breakfast blend (that is coffee). I was given the espresso in a paper bag with green electrical tape. I asked if I could have a freshness bag they said no. I had to ask why. Then the agent said because I did not buy a full pound (that would have change my purchase amount if I would have known that). I then asked again if the espresso was a fine grind because it felt kinda rocky in the bag and I just wanted to confirm I was getting what I asked for (I have MS and I do not have a lot of feeling in my hands). I then left and went home and gave the espresso to my husband and he opened the bag and said this is a course grind. I was very disappointed. Their espresso is expensive and it was a gift.

Sometimes  a bit too bubbly  for the morning,  but that's definitely  okay with me because I  am usually  full of adrenaline after my gym workout.  Therefore, the cheerfulness  is absolutely  welcome.Love  coming  here  especially after my Saturday  morning  workouts when I want to treat myself occasionally to a mocha latte as it's  usually  not too busy and there's  usually  no more than two  people  in front  of me.Being  in Liberty  Village, it's  definitely  a great place for people watching.

I was greeted by the bartender/waitress/karaoke host Lily dancing around and singing and yelling ""Happy St Patricks"". Sold immediately. Karaoke Friday and Saturday. Small beer selection on tap, but good enough. Six-ish dollars a pint. The locals were the friendliest I've encountered in Ontario. Walked in alone, walked out with three email addresses and many hugs. The kitchen is apparently open late but I wasn't hungry. Menu looked good. Mozza sticks. Burgers. Speghetti. Nachos. The usual.

Pricey, but not outrageous.Food: We shared the pico de gallo, and I had a shrimp taco (although I'd ordered fish - see 'Service', below) and the mushroom burrito. We also shared the churro sundae and the fudge plate. Everything was very good - fresh, flavourful, satisfying, good portions, and not too heavy (except dessert, but hey, when you order a churro sundae you know what you're in for).Drink: I had a cocktail, which was very nicely constructed; a good balance of sweet/dry. The beer selection looked good as well.Atmosphere: we were outside on a sunny day on comfortable furniture - can't ask for more than that!Service: Some of the issue can be chalked up to inexperience and understaffing, but a lot was a simple lack of polish and organization. I think the layout may also have contributed - pathways are a smidge tight and the bar seems to be a specific area of difficulty (although I usually expect to wait longer for a cocktail, the beer took even longer).I want to be clear- everyone was very friendly, energetic and kind, which is the most important thing. However, all the staff seemed to lack important service basics - empty plates/glasses were left on the table throughout our meal; dishes went to the wrong table, or werethe wrong order; it took our neighbours 15 minutes to get water; servers were having what should have been private conversations about restaurant issues in front of diners, etc. etc.I'm rooting for Chula, and I do recommend it! I just hope that the service issues can be sorted out before too long, and I can update this review :)

Unfortunately, the lineup was out the door and so we did not get to sit on the patio (even after having made reservations prior). Appetizers were yum but small, so we wish we had ordered 2 of everything. We ordered the zucchini fritters, shrimp ceviche, and chorizo corn dog. Ceviche has quite the kick so those who are afraid of spice, beware.Tacos were small and lacked flavour. We had ordered the spicy butterflied shrimp, pork shoulder, beer battered fish, and soft shell crab. To be honest, they all tasted the same - nothing made them unique or independently flavoured. We actually had to ask ourselves which one we ate after finishing. Also, not sure if we were just unlucky but the soft shell crab one was really fishy and smelled like the ocean.Desserts, we tried all 3. Churros sundae was probably my favourite of the night!! Other 2 were nothing to rave about. Overall I'm glad I tried this place but I'd say it's overrated. I find the menu to be way overpriced for the quality and quantity of food. For $5-$7 a taco, La Carnita is a way better taco joint. I probably will not return.

I love the decor and the mural in the back is awesome! It really does feel like an authentic Mexican experience. Our server was so kind and came by many times to check up on us, and see if we needed anything. The food is decently priced and you get a fair amount. The waiting time wasn't long at all. I ordered the vegan option, so the mushroom tacos. It was satiating and delicious. At first glace, I was underwhelmed with the portion I got, expecting more, but prior to finishing, I was definitely full! So all in all, this is a great place to come with friends for an affordable dinner with a lovely setting! Thank you, Chula!!
209|1K4qrnfyzKzGgJPBEcJaNQ|Esy7r4Dv37lMCBBcyYJ8NQ|BfDlTQHYOhN4yR9_egMyEA|Toronto|Chula Taberna Mexicana|-79.3359022|43.66925620000001|M4M 3A6|Chula is such a great addition to the east end! My husband and I came here for an early dinner, however it was so early that the place was dead, so we ended up getting the food to go. We'd definitely eat-in next time though, as the restaurant decor is awesome. We got the Perro de Maiz (Chorizo Corn dogs), the Carnita taco, the Cangrejo de Concha Blanda taco (Soft shell crab), the Seta Picante taco (Grilled spicy mushroom), and the Cola de Langosta taco (Whole rock lobster tail). The food surpassed my expectations! The soft shell crab seemed to be a bit over-breaded, and that is probably the only one I wouldn't get again. My favourites were the Chorizo Corn dogs and the Lobster taco. Even though we only got take out, everyone working there was super nice and friendly when we were waiting for our food at the bar. I can't wait to come back!

All 4 of us loved the pork taco the best. The beef brisket and shrimp are decent too. I took 1 star off because the stale chips were guacamole dips. I'm also surprise they don't give free chips.
211|1K4qrnfyzKzGgJPBEcJaNQ|ENxaQOsBcG190ShQl-s7wQ|D-71neazoCYYQkgHnS92FQ|Toronto|Chula Taberna Mexicana|-79.3359022|43.66925620000001|M4M 3A6|A beautiful and cozy little place! Randomly found it while walking around. The interiors are very nice, and clean. They have two patios and excellent custom service. The server was friendly, quick and had great suggestions. This is a great place for families with small kids to visit.They have a great menu and tons of vegetarian items. We tried the corn, zucchini tacos and fried avocado. The corn was excellent, their version of elotes. Definitely a must try. The zucchini tacos were yummy as it was crispy and has a good amount of salsa. The fried avocado was ok, was not a huge fan and was one small avocado for the price of $9. The prices were okay, but portion sizes were small. The chula beer was excellent and another must try. Also got a margarita with black salt! It was tasty and pretty. Would come back here and try other items on their menu but mostly the corn and chula beer again!

Tacos, sangria, enchiladas... all Met or exceeded expectations, and came out lightening fast!  The patio is the place to be if you can get a seat.  Eat local, eat often and enjoy!

Service was friendly and efficient. I ordered the red pepper bowl which was quite tasty. Full of guac, rice, beans, peppers, tortilla chips and more. My friend had the brisket and shrimp tacos and said both were quite meh, small and simple. I'm not sure I would go back because it's out of the way and there are much better Mexican spots in the city.

Their beef taco was well seasoned, butterfly shrimp, and pork shoulder were all decent. We also had the corn as an appetizer and that was good too. The guacamole is the kind you'd make at home.Cons -- The service and cocktails left much to be desired. Let's start with the cocktails. The bartender was sniffing the drinks rather than tasting them while making them. This resulted in a very limey cocktail (the El Rey and the Humo Grande). The service was patchy at best. We had to ask for hot sauce with our tacos (they were on some of the other tables) and even when the server brought them over, there was only one. Will I go again? Probably not.
215|1K4qrnfyzKzGgJPBEcJaNQ|jNQqI-YdHRYDDZHoWZ5s6Q|0Mfs3RDXYtuBnJ1RHWqeAA|Toronto|Chula Taberna Mexicana|-79.3359022|43.66925620000001|M4M 3A6|The neighbourhood definitely needed a Mexican restaurant and Chula does not disappoint! We got the guacamole to start (awesome), chicken enchilada and a bunch of different tacos. All the tacos were amazing but the beer battered fish ones were our favourite. Had churro sundae and fudge duo for dessert and both were phenomenal. We tried almost all of the margaritas and they were all great! The vibe here is great and the service was top notch. We had a very fun evening!
216|1K4qrnfyzKzGgJPBEcJaNQ|ncpi0UgdRMzNEqBTNB3kXw|KUoC_17V2vg0jfYr2NsSbg|Toronto|Chula Taberna Mexicana|-79.3359022|43.66925620000001|M4M 3A6|Went on a Saturday afternoon around 2pm, weather was sunny, hot, patio weather like.  Made no appointments as it was not busy when we arrived.  Called just in case to see if we needed to make an reservation but they said no need as it generally gets busy later in the evening, and they were right.  Once we sat there for a good 10 mins, we noticed people started to come in, one by one.  Server were alright, it would be nice if  they described which taco was which, as we ordered 3 different tacos and could barely tell the difference.  We got the churrizo corn dog as the appetizers, it was alright, kind of blend, the hint of spice was good.  The tomatoe/corn sauce on top was a good touch to compensate the blend taste.  We got 3 tacos, pulled pork, chicken, brisket.  I would say i was dissapointed,  tasted a bit blend as well.  I had high hopes for the taco wrap as the pictures on yelp made it look delicious, but tasted kind of like card board and tasted tough.  And I've had my fair share of real good tasting tacos.  Compared to when i went to dominican/cuba before.  I had high hopes itll somewhat taste the same or more or less at least a different twist.And finally for drinks we got the carribana and the sunrise cocktail, did not end up finishing it but they were pretty good if you like the super boozy taste.  The carribana cocktail you can taste the hint of coconut and was a good level of sweetness, same goes with the sunrise.  It had a good puch taste and nice touch of slush ice for a hot sunny day.Would i go back, probably not for a while.

I assume the food was close to going bad so they salted it. We got food poisoning that night and we assume it was from the food.

Had the tortilla chips with all 3 dips and pork burrito bowl. I love burritos but don't particularly like it being in the wrap. The burrito bowls were an excellent and tasty alternative. Everything was delicious and the customer service was on par. I'll definitely be back again! L

Double rooftop patios is a HUGE plus.  Tequila bar equals double plus.  The food was delicious and appropriately priced.  The service was awesome (Gisele was our waitstaff's name).....very observant and quick.  If you are looking for a great night out this is the place to go.

Well done. One of the biggest reasons I went. The other is a new spot on the east side of town which seemed kinda fun.I have to say after reading what everyone else has said. I can't say I disagree. I had high hopes for the food. It fell short on flavour.  We didn't even finish our ceviche which  I always do because  it's a go to fave for me.We were seated in the second floor dining area. Same level as the patio so I had to check it out. It looks amazing. Maybe in the summer. The service was sporadic. Present in the beginning but absent after the food was served. We waited forever for someone to come by to the point where we just flagged down another server to get our bill.It's not a bad spot. It just had no standouts in terms of food. we ordered a variety of tacos to share too. The drinks - cocktails and beer - were okay. I'd say if they bumped up their food flavour game and worked a bit more on customer service this would be a solid spot. It has a ton of potential. The interior design is incredibly inviting so I'm crossing my fingers.

A new Mexican place with a 2 tier outdoor patio?  Sounds pretty good to me!   Definitey make reservations b/c as the new ""it"" place it gets PACKED.  We got a table for 2 outside on the first level patio.  The tables are tiny and squished together so you get to know your neighbours well.  In our case this was a good thing as we talked about the food with the couple beside us (who were just about to leave).We ordered several tacos - a few each of the spicy mushroom, the shrimp and the chicken to share.  All in all they were ok but I felt they were lacking some acidity/zing to them.  They got a little soggy as well so a bit difficult to eat.  Nothing spectacular.  We also ordered the churros/ice cream on the advice of our table neighbours.  You can never go wrong with churros!  They were delicious but honestly it isn't hard to screw them upI think the draw of this place is the outdoor patios.  On the first level, the middle of the restaurant has those lounge-y outdoor garden patio sets where you can sink back and relax with your drink.  Very nice place to chill - right by the tiki bar.  Yes they have a tiki bar.  It's all things kitsch with the décor.The service is really friendly if a bit slow, but understandable as it was slammed that particular Saturday.  I might come back for some drinks but I think I'll pass on the food unless I'm super hungry."

Location is far from downtown but worth it. Reasonably priced drinks and food. The ceviche was differnt but really good. Chips and dip were all great. Skip the crab taco, fried and you couldn't taste the crab much. Everything else was good. Service was slow but they had just opened a month before I went and they were VERY busy for a Tuesday night.

PROS1) Service was VERY attentive and friendly. 2) The ambiance was great - excellent vibe and could have hung out on the patio all day!3) This is a great place to come for a fun night out. CONS1) It is overpriced for what it is. I felt I was paying for ambiance more than anything else. 2) Of the bunch of different tacos I tried (4 in total); they were similar in taste and not particularly distinct in flavour 3) Lacked authenticity and the menu items are a classic case of the gentrification of 'Mexican' food

I came with some girlfriends on a Saturday night. The atmosphere was perfect to celebrate a birthday with great music and good energy on the patio. The food left much to be desired. I did appreciate that they were willing to make modifications to menu items. Overall, I didn't feel any items I tried were amazing or worth making a trip out to the east end. The biggest disappointment was that they didn't have churros (they have a churro sundae bowl but we just wanted regular churros and that dessert couldn't be modified).
227|1K4qrnfyzKzGgJPBEcJaNQ|QKQUgYGZNCHxjcneihHdZw|GFtn06TL7KcxUMdRHHql-A|Toronto|Chula Taberna Mexicana|-79.3359022|43.66925620000001|M4M 3A6|It's a nice addition to the neighbourhood. This location used to be a local pub that kind of lost its way, now Chula moved in. The food is good, I had the pork, rice, corn and bean dish. My partner had beef brisket burrito.  His dish was good, he loved it, mine na not so much, it was hearty but missing something and I think it was sour cream. They may want to offer that as a side or add it entirely. We also had drinks, I had 2 beer and my partner had a beer and a mojito. When we received the bill we were a bit taken back, $67.00  before tip. Considering the portion size and two drinks each that's pricey. I wish them well because I think they're on to something in the neighbourhood however I think their prices may eventually hurt their business. Give them a try and see what you think.

I wanted more, and I expected to come back. I'm surprised to read that some people were less enthused by their food.  It wasn't the best tacos I've ever head, but it was definitely above average, and I basically didn't have any complaints with the food.The place was busy, noisy (because it was busy), there were a few mixups with the order and a server dropped a tray of drinks nearby, so it was a bit too chaotic. I hope that it will calm down a little and that the food consistency will settle in (since my food was great, and other people seem less enthused), and everyone will agree this is a nice place to go for drinks and food.Give it a bit of time to find its rhythm, then give it a try.

Located in...I think its called East York.  They have 2 upper floors for patio seating.  Cool spot if you're not looking to go downtown.  Loved their variety on the menu.  We had a business luncheon and ordered a few different types if tacos, a salad, chips, pico de gallo and guac.  I really liked the guac.  Tacos were soggy and falling apart tho with the liquid sitting on the platter.  Unfortunately I didn't have any drinks as it was a work meeting.  Maybe next time! Definitely gonna check out the dinner scene before i decide on my final 3 star rating of the place. Street parking (not really my liking)

(Meanwhile I'm still mourning the closure of The Willow near Broadview and Danforth...)The back patio is super cute and worth the trip alone, but their food is delicious to boot! Prices are very reasonable, and both the tacos and corn were just bursting with flavour (seriously, try the corn - you won't regret it). My only critiques are that the tortillas are quite thin and delicate, so it broke while eating and turned into a hot mess (a tasty hot mess), and that the menu is a bit small (no mole dishes, sadly). But I will definitely be going back!

Cheap drinks (try the $5 Chula Lager brewed by Wellington) and great apps - we had the chips & dips, zucchini fritters, shrimp ceviche, chorizo and crispy avocado and all were very tasty with terrifically flavourful sauces. Tacos were top notch - tortillas could have been a bit fresher but still kept together. Tried chicken, shrimp, beef and lobster. All great. And the dessert - churo sundae - amazingA+ service as well

Very cool little place with an inspiring new menu.Some of the items are true winners.  The guacamole is first class, with the Cremoso Jalapeño cheese dip.The tacos are also mostly good.  I could use a little more fish in the fish taco but all very tasty.I had the Rock Lobster, Fish, Beef, Chicken were all excellent.Fried Avocado was not a winner for me.The sweets are also very good.  Citrus Margarita bars was my favorite, and the Churros were good but the dough is to soft and is hard to dip into the sauces without breaking apart.Great local gem.  Looking forward to coming back.

My father inlaw is not a salad person but he loved the kale salad, he even had second helpings. We ordered the zucchini, pollo, and spicy shrimp tacos,  calamari, and corn. Everything we had is excellent. The staff are friendly and attentive. The atmosphere inside and outside is great. Definitely 5/5 stars!

We went in last night and were seated immediately. The server was really friendly, quick and professional. We wanted to try a few things, so we ended up with some fried cod tacos, tortillas and guac and the chorizo corndogs. Everything was frankly way better than I expected (remember that aforementioned skepticism?). The guac was fresh, chunky and really dynamic, not to mention clearly made in house. The accompanying chips were tasty and grease free, which was nice. The fish tacos were really good, a bit busier than I usually like. I found the fish to be slightly overcooked; but seeing as I tend to prefer my proteins slightly under I assume this is me being picky, and not an actual reflection of the kitchen. But the best thing was the chorizo corn dog. I'm almost tempted to go back tonight and get another one! We even got the churro sundae and it was delicious! But I'm glad I shared; it was very sweet and rich!The room was nice, the bar was cool and the mural was really pretty. The only thing that underwhelmed was the bathroom -waaay too small and cramped! But if that's the worst thing I can say, there's really no complaints.

Yeah, not so much. The items on their menu are not labelled with any gluten info so the waiter's suggestions were really helpful. All of the seemingly gluten-free options that are fried, such as tortilla chips and the cornmeal crusted calamari, are contaminated as they are fried in the same vat as the wheat flour fried items. The tortillas for the tacos are made from corn while the burrito ones are made with wheat. About half of the tacos offered are not gluten-free (3 are wheat flour battered), including the chirizo (normally a gluten-free standard) because it is marinated in beer. Noooo! I ended up going with the pollo tacos and they were delicious. For reference, I have a gluten sensitivity and minor cross contamination (few crumbs) doesn't bother me severely. I had no reactions with this place, but I also actively avoided eating the fried items that I knew would be cross contaminated. The reason I'm giving this place 4 stars instead of less for the minimal gluten-free options is because the wait staff are super helpful and try their best to work with your allergies. Also the ambiance of the place is fantastic, especially their back patio, which is a must for summer days. TL ;DR minimal GF options, great ambiance

It was a nice night and we had a reservation so we were able to score a seat on the patio. Me and my husband ordered mixed drinks, a margarita and a ""Mexican sunrise"". Both were delicious, came cold and refreshing, the bar tender gave us a solid pour. We decided to order a bunch of different things just to try. We tried: the carnita tacos (3), the zucchini fritters, the chorizo corndogs, the brisket burrito, the shrimp ceviche and the chicken lollipops. There were no complaints  by anyone. Everything was very fresh, service was frequently and efficient. Dishes came out as they were ready (as indicated on the menu). The corndogs are a bit heavy, and fritters my favourite item, was a wee bit oily but nothing you can't get over. I ordered a sangria towards the middle of the meal and I didn't get it until we were almost finished. This meant I had to chug it before we could leave. It would not deter me from coming back however. The patio was quite congested, I think they have one too many chairs out there, but it's a good vibe so again no complaints. The tiki hut on the back patio is so cute, a very nice touch. Overall, a great new addition to the neighbour, any Mexican food lover will not be disappointed."

The employees and whoever had the foresight to hire them deserve a lot of credit. They are as quick as they can be given all the possibilities, and they are kind.The tea is also great. Occasionally, some teas smell better than they taste (any tea with chocolate is this way for me). However, they definitely have something to suit your taste.Located near Chipotle just north of Yonge-Dundas Square, this location is easy to find.

This is like any typical David's but it does seem wider than some I have been to. I was only there to get a cold tea and I was looking for whatever was ready. They had a strawberry and rhubarb or a black so I went with the black unsweetened. I like the fact that they have it ready as opposed to some Teavana that don't. I usually leave the tea buying to my wife but I like getting some once in a while whether it be a tin or bag. I prefer the black type while my wife likes milk oohlong. They have a deal going on now where if you buy a travel mug you can buy an iced tea for a dollar.The staff here are friendly as as usual no tax on loose tea even the ones they make to go ($3 even).

Since my first visit, I was hooked. The staff is incredibly attentive, pleasant and at times it seems like they have memorized every single ingredient of every single tea they offer. The product itself is delicious hot and on ice! I bought one of their pitchers and make my own iced tea daily. It's become a part of my routine. I highly recommend Davids Tea and especially this particular location.

I must say it was a good time and experience. There is a whole wall filled with different teas that will float your boat and suit your fancy. I got the Queen of Tart, which tasted as it name says. It was tarty, which is good for my preference. You can always ask them servers to add more sugar depending on your preference.The huge selling point for this location was the wonderful attitude and service the employees provided for us. My friend spilled his drink literally a few seconds after grabbing it off the counter and the employees immediately apologized for our mistake. They did not have to but they even offered to clean the spill for us. My friend got another drink from the employees pretty quickly too. Gotta say I'm a little bias for their service and they were fairly attractive too. Overall, I would come again if I was in Toronto.

The staff is amazing and patient and they offer samples of their tea and introduce all their great new mixes! They have been the best location! I got the earl garden but they do know their stuff about tea, caffeine levels and what not! This was a black tea based! Plus they do not charge extra for soy unlike Starbucks! I can't wait to try a new tea every time!

Burgers, salad, chicken, and steak were delicious.  We were seated at a family style wood table with dripping wax candelabras and lights were low so an intimate ambiance. A few of my friends I was with were here before and said the food was still just as delicious as last time. Would go again, maybe for lunch to sit on outdoor patio.

Le décor est moderne et accueillant, un peu lounge. L'accueil est chaleureux. La vue sur le quartier des spectacles est superbe !Nous ne savons pas trop que prendre, alors nous demandons conseil au serveur, qui ne semble pas trop passionné par quelque chose en particulier. Soit qu'il n'a pas goûté ou bien il n'aime pas. Nous optons pour les calmars frits en entrée, servis avec une mayonnaise maison, qui sont LES MEILLEURS que j'ai eu la chance de manger. Il s'agit de VRAIS morceaux de calmar enrobés d'une légère panure de style tempura. Aucun goût caoutchouteux, j'aime ça !Pour le repas principal, je choisis la bavette. Elle est assez ordinaire, sans saveur et la  pièce n'est pas tellement tendre. Le prix dudit repas est assez dispendieux pour un steak moyen et des calmars. Je ne sais pas si j'y retournerais bien franchement. Probablement pour un 5 a 7, mais pas pour le repas. Ils ont de bons spéciaux après 22h, mais c'est un peu tard pour moi.

I have to admit that I live and work in the area, so I tend to stay away from it during prime tourist/jazz festival season since I can enjoy the restaurant at any time of the year.  While I can't comment on their food or service when they're running at full tilt, I would say it's not to be missed in the fall, winter, or even spring.  My experience has always been excellent and although the menu isn't inexpensive, I don't find that it's overly expensive for the quality of food and service that you receive.  Add the fact that it's a non profit and all the proceeds go to funding our amazing Jazz Festival every year, and it's a no brainer choice for a lovely meal in the Quartier des Spectacles.

Prices weren't too overly expensive, as we ordered up a bottle of Moet & Chandon Imperial to go with our fantastic French Onion soup and a cheese plate, salad and a veggie platter. Salad was good as well. Great atmosphere, (we dined al fresco) friendly staff, l recommend this place.

Of those things, they hit 2/3. Board games were a ton of fun and the selection was great. We spent about 5.5 hours there and actually made it within 15 minutes of closing at about 1:30am. The tea selection is also pretty extensive; some of the teas are also hand blended/mixed in-house and may take a bit longer to prepare. I had the Bazaar blend (hand mixed) and it was excellent. The right balance of a strong black tea with a unique mixture of spices including saffron that brought a nice twist. The downsides now. While the tea was good, the snacks were just okay. And we tried quite a few of them. Vegetarian curry, peppermint chocolate cake, boterkoek, hummus and salad and bowl of bits and bites (kind of like a trail mix). None of those were great and worth ordering again in my eyes. But it's good to have some snacks while indulging in the tea and games. Another downside was the service - VE-RY SLOW. It's a good thing the board games kept us distracted. Other than that, the seating is comfy and cafe is very Bohemian inspired. I thought it was a nice surprise to find out some of the art work on display can be purchased.Overall, would recommend Bampot for a fun night of board games and great tea!

It offers a HUGE range of different types of tea and amazing interior. You can also play board games if you wish to, and there are is usually a small selection of food. The main weakness is the service. I have been here twice and both times I had to either wait a long time to be served or go find a server myself. The problem is that you need to grab your own menu (which is fine) but then because of that they don't keep track of who comes in.

If you know me, you would likely notice my clutch word or filler word is ""interesting"". I use the word to describe situations that are different, uncomfortable or fascinating. Often, I use the word when I do not know how to respond or to fill the gap (that may otherwise be a silent void). Bampot House of Tea & Board Games, I would say embodies the word ""interesting"". It is truly where people from different worlds collide. It feels like a mutli-verse - one corner of the room may have people jamming with guitar, the other  corner is filled with people enjoying board games, somewhere in a hidden corner is a person quietly working hard on their project. At times, you may overhear conversations related to overcoming limiting beliefs, provoking spiritual awakening or just waves after waves of laughter.Even the password of the wifi is contemplative - ""maybe there is more to life, maybe not"".The food at Bampot is earnest, poignant and hearty. There is something special about a bowl of hot soup, hearty stew or sincere curry to warm you up from the inside and out on a cold day. My soup of the day, Spicy beet with chickpea soup ($7.50) was full of warmth. It was accompanied by simple toast and coconut butter. Vegetarian rejoice.All the food served at Bampot are vegetarian friendly!There are also endless selections of teas for every flavor profile. Different tea for different peeps! My favourite at Bampot is surprisingly not tea; it is the dark hot chocolate with housemade almond milk. It was the perfect soulful drink with a hint of sweetness. The white pot and cup with silver embossed lace even matches my OOTD (outfit of the day). It must mean we are meant to be! ;) Sitting in a small booth alone at Bampot, surrounded by rustic cushion with a warm bowl of soup and observing life is the wonderful way to spend a quiet evening."

We both love tea and board games so it was the perfect combination. We went to check it out a couple of weeks after it opened. The environment of the cafe definitely suits the name. The cafe is decorated with yellow, orange, and dark red walls, reminding me of the Indian culture. There are some areas where you can sit in the nooks and crannies of the cafe with only pillows and drapes, giving off that bohemian vibe. The space gives a lot of intimacy compared to most places I have been to; which is nice and unique to Bampot. Bampot serves a vast selection of tea, some with free refills. Like most places, it has a $5 sitting fee if you would like to play the board games. However, it only costs $3 if you decide to order food. My boyfriend got the soup of the day, which was some sort of Thai curry soup the owners whipped up. He absolutely loved it and I enjoyed it as well. It had that spicy flavour that curry lovers would be familiar with. I had the Quangzhou Milk Oolong tea, which tasted exactly what you would expect a milk tea would taste like. It wasn't my favourite, but I didn't mind drinking it either. For each pot of tea you receive, you get a timer as well, so you know when the tea is perfectly steeped. Between my boyfriend and I, we pretty much drained all the hot water they had for our free refills haha.There are currently about 160 games available and when I was there, many of them were unopened. My boyfriend was in heaven for a short period of time after I found a brand new Firefly board game towards the end of our stay. Unfortunately it was a two hour game and we were already there for about two to three hours. He sadly had to wave goodbye to it.The cafe hosts different events here and now. They have Scrabble Night on Mondays and free knitting lessons often. They planned on having a Dungeons and Dragons game night as well. The owners said that they were looking for games to host events for. If you are a game enthusiast and would like to bring an event to Bampot, definitely reach out to them!Overall, I highly recommend Bampot. It's so good that it's now my boyfriend's favourite board game place, knocking Snakes and Lattes to his second favourite. This is definitely a great date location to spend with your significant other. Also if you are a tea enthusiast, it is a must to visit! The cafe is very intimate and cozy with such a lovely staff. I don't recommend coming in with a large group of friends unless you are willing to break the group down. It's best to have no more than three (or at most four) other friends with you because of the space. The cafe also has hookah available as well.

I'm so happy that such a unique, comfortable tea place exists!

The best word that comes to mind is cozy: this place is just so warm and cozy, and would be a great place to chill on a chilly fall or winter day. I came on a Sunday afternoon with a group of 4 other friends around 1 PM - it was pretty quiet when we first came in, but was a lot fuller when we left about 2 hours later. I love the decor in this place, there are so many colours and different pieces (carpets, curtains, tapestries, pillows) and it's so fun and eclectic, this place just has so much character. It is pretty accomodating for groups of various sizes, although I probably wouldn't come with a group larger than 5 or 6. We sat on some couches around a little coffee table, but it looked like most of the other seating areas were meant to fit groups of 2 or 3. I didn't actually look at the board game selection, but my group ended up playing one that I've never heard of before, so that was fun.They have an extensive tea selection - I had the honey spice tea and it was kind of like a chai tea but a little bit sweeter and less cinnamon-y. I also had a salad and added a side of pita and hummus. The pita was so good, it was so thick and soft, and my only complaint here would be that there wasn't more. The salad was also pretty good, it had a lot of stuff in it like cashews and the vinagrette is house-made and very flavourful. Vegetarians will be happy to note that all the food options here are vegetarian and most are also vegan. My meal ended up being $18 after tax.I can definitely see myself coming back here, even if it's just to chill and chat with some friends. I saw lots of small groups nestled in these little nooks all around the place, and some people had even brought knitting supplies with them. It looked so cozy!

When you first walk in, the restaurant asks you to please take off your shoes. Word of advice: It's a great idea to wear socks if you don't want to use the slippers provided by the restaurant and if you want to leave with clean feet.  I'm a bit of a germaphobe, so I wasn't too thrilled about taking off my shoes.From afar, the restaurant looks small but once you are inside, you realize it is much bigger.  The venue has tons of seating and a bohemian-like ambiance. Bampot provides guests with little nooks where they can relax in a comfortable environment. The nooks have carpeting and pillows for you to just lounge. They also have some traditional table settings as well. The idea is to make you feel at home. The restaurant also has a room with shelving and tons of games available for play. We didn't play any games on this night but it was nice to know we had the option. The menu is also pretty awesome! Bampot can accommodate vegans and people who are gluten and/or lactose intolerant. Talk about a win!I shared a vegan cheesecake with a friend and it was the best gluten and dairy free cheesecake I have ever had!  I would revisit Bampot just to have another slice of the blueberry cheesecake.  While there, I also tried the gluten and dairy free stew and falafels. Both dishes tasted amazing! I especially liked the falafels. Now onto the tea (the real reason we came here). Bampot has an extensive tea menu. They have tons of teas for you to choose from including some featured teas such as Unicorn Blood. It sounds disgusting but it is oh so amazing. My friend bought it and it was delicious. Later in the evening, I described the type of tea I was craving to the waitress and she created a tea blend that wasn't on the menu just for me. The tea tasted amazing and everyone in our group tried it and loved it as well. Of course, I had to ask the waitress what she did and she told me she blended strawberry kiwi and apple cider tea. This combination is so amazing, you'll have to try it!!I highly recommend this restaurant café and believe you will love it too.

Was surprised the second I stepped in bc you can take your shoes off and wear slippers (apparently you can also keep your shoes on if it's summer). Someone in an alcove was singing along to her guitar when we arrived. It was magical. We were told that we could explore the space and make ourselves comfortable wherever we liked. The owner came by and spent quite a while telling us about how he prepared his Bam Bam Chai, his ice teas, how he got the idea for Bampot. The curry we ordered was delicious. It tasted quite wholesome. I was surprised by how good the iced green tea was. It had a light lychee flavour (?) which made the tea perfect for summer.Bampot also has a selection of boardgames which you can play at 1 boardgame for $3 (if you order a main). The only downside here is the wait for food. It's definitely not the place to go to if you're in a rush. Overall, it has a really special ambiance. Would definitely recommend checking it out if you're into teas and relaxing spaces with a Bohemian vibe.

Being at Bampot feels like spending an afternoon at your favourite Grandma's house. Order the sharing snack plate!Came here on a rainy Saturday and this place could not be more perfect. It beats all the other board game cafes in the city. FOOD: We ordered the ballad salad, the shared snack plate and the homemade chai tea. I couldn't pick a favourite if you forced me. They have a huge, high quality tea menu and a good selection of foods and desserts.Ballad Salad: garlicky, nutty, and fresh. It's a simple salad but the ginger garlic dressing is to die for. Sharing Plate: Nuts & Bolts, Cheese & Crackers, Hummus & Pita. All ingredients are high quality, fresh and simple. Very well done. Chai Tea: milky, spicy and sweet. Comes in a lovely clay pot and warms you up. ATMOSPHERE We sat on a raised platforms on pillows with our shoes off. Very unique, and great atmosphere for playing games. There are also regular tables if that's more your style. They have about 100+ board games and a large selection of books. We played Pandemic (the BEST 2 person game) & Mr. Jack.

Super cozy and hippie feeling, which I loved. Their game selection is okay, with lots of well known games, but nothing too out of the ordinary. Tea selection is amazing! Not your weird new age tea flavours, more of a subtle spin on classic teas (which I like a lot better than your new cotton candy, or birthday cake type flavours). The owners and super friendly too.

There is nothing else like it in the city. Easily my new favourite place.ATMOSPHERE - Outstanding atmosphere! So cozy and colourful, the Morrocan-themed and earthy-inspired decor is so well selected, with great attention to detail. There are a variety of seating options - from seated platforms, to the standard table & chairs, to armchairs and couches. TEA - They have more than 50 teas of all kinds of varieties - including specialty blends with hand-blended herbs and seasonings - which come by the pot at reasonable prices (which vary depending on the tea). Give yourself some time with the tea menu! It will tempt you in all different directions.FOOD - Plenty of options to nosh on. Daily main, usually a curry, and a daily soup. Nice selection of both savoury and sweet snacks. All at decent prices. I had the best chocolate cake I've ever had! Check out the much-loved Bampot original: poutine soup!GAMES - Good selection of board games! Nicely organized and categorized in the board game library. * Bonuses * - HOOKAHS - Tobacco-free shisha in many flavours! - ACCESSIBILITY - Barrier-free entrance (ramp to doorway) and barrier-free washroom on main floor.- Such a great place to bring DATES!

My boyfriend and I went last night, because I had a craving for their pita and hummus (they put raisins and nuts of some sort in their pita, it's delicious). While we were waiting for our food, we decided that we would like a glass of water. Bampot has a tank of water at the front, and you serve yourself. Usually this works out great, but last night when we arrived, they were out of cups. So we asked our server if he could bring some out. He said sure thing... five minutes later, he still hadn't brought them out. We weren't asking for him to do anything particularly time-consuming, we just wanted a vessel to fill with water to drink. So we asked another employee (this took awhile, because employees are almost always at the back, not out where the customers are, so we had to wait for someone to come out). She said sure thing, she'd grab some right away... again, no cups. Finally, a third employee came out (she's actually one of the co-owners of the place) and we asked her for cups. She was able to provide, for which I was thankful. Nonetheless, getting a glass of water should not be a 25 minute process, and for that Bampot has lost a star.

The atmosphere is relaxing and cozy and social, the tea selection is wonderful, and the owners are a great combination of laid-back, friendly, and yet serious about their business. They clearly view the place as a community-building hub. A couple of the staff are inconsistent and bring the cafe down, but please give Bampot another chance, if you happened to fall upon an aloof or surly employee.  Finally, it's nice that their menu accommodates vegans and GF diets, but the food isn't good or diverse, so don't come here for dinner. Come for the fantastic tea and a chat, or a light board-game with old and new friend(s).

The time when you don't want to eat but nibble on your favorite popcorn and hummus dip!! This is it, friends this is the place for you. The staff are fantastic too I want to steal their outfits and their accent ( you get the picture!) very bohemian is what I am trying to say. The hookha here is tobacco free yet full of flavour seriously the best I have had and I have had way too many from the Mid East to Mexico. I didn't feel sick after also the price is great $13. Popcorn was sadly soggy but the tea made up for it ...how is it possible to get one type of tea here?!!! Even after spending 15 minutes deciding!

They have all sorts of tasty teas, adorable teapots and an intriguing menu (Poutine soup you say? why yes, it IS fantastic!).  The vibe is cozy and bohemian and everyone I've brought there so far has loved it!This is not a place to grab and dash, but rather bring a notebook and/or friends and have a lovely afternoon/evening.  The owners are friendly, fun, and accommodating and just generally great people to hang out with.  See the other reviews for more detail on teas and food, I can't recommend strongly enough!

The building is so cute on the outside, but there is lots of space inside! The decor is really warm and inviting. You can go in find a place to settle and the owners are incredibly friendly and helpful.I tried the faerie's blood tea and it was full of flavour! This is not your run of the mill tea shop. When you get tea here expect a well crafted tea with depth. There are lots of teas to choose from, I look forward to coming back and trying more!I had the pita and hummus with a house salad and a decadent chocolate cake. They pay attention to detail even with their food! They are starting a Monday night craft circle. I was able to participate and learned some great knitting tips!I didn't play any games this time, but they seemed to have a great selection. I will definitely be coming back.

I really enjoyed the Tibetan lavender tea. They also have hookah and board games. I love the sitting arrangement and the decor of this place and how intimate the place feels. I also love how the menu is entirely vegetarian and has vegan options. The staff are very friendly and welcoming. Location is close to Bathurst station. I will definitely be back.

I had walked by this place so many times, vaguely curious but never venturing in. I'm so glad I did. It's like walking into Narnia, skylights and cozy nooks built out of pillows and lovely wood, plants everywhere. Huge tea menu, $5 + seems pricey for a cup of tea at first, but they're actually served in beautiful hand made pots that keep the tea at a perfect hot temperature with enough to sit and sip for a couple of hours. I never partook in the food or the board games while I was there ( though I appreciate that there isn't a cover for anyone who walks in like some games cafes. They only charge if you decide to play) but the food menu looked great and I'm excited to go back and sample it. Thanks for creating an oasis in the annex guys, I'll be back soon!

It's amazing in so many different ways.Bampot's selection of board games is like it's selection of teas: vast and awesome.They have their board games split up into sections (strategy, casual, etc.), and in your menu will come a sheet with the board games listed into sections, with the average playtime per game listed, too. Since Bampot is brand new, the board games are too! I broke open seasons to find that the game hadn't been played yet since the cards were still in their packages! No ratty old board games here!The cover fee to play board games is $5 if you don't eat, $3 if you do.There are, I believe, over 70 different teas you can try here. I'm not a big tea person, but I sipped some of my friends teas (apple mint, and faerie's blood), and they were both delicious (especially the faerie's blood, which is steeped with not only the tea but fresh fruit also.) Many of the teas also have free refills :)They have a non-tea menu for people like myself, with items like Maple Milk & Hot Chocolate. I paid about $3 for not just a cup but a POT of DELICIOUS hot chocolate - some pretty great value there.The food kicks some serious butt too. I gorged on Poutine SOUP (yep, it IS as amazing as it sounds), Chocolate Strawberry Cake (chocolatety, decadent, delicious), and a yummy yummy ""posh"" cheese board.The staff are extremely nice, they are happy to chat, help you wade through the giant tea menu, provide both tea and board game reccomendations, and more.The decor is also cozy and adorable. It gives off the feeling of playing board games and/or enjoying some tea in a friend's living room.There is also shisha available, a Monday Night Craft Circle, and other events in the works.I can't wait to come back. I will definitely be returning. What a gem!"

Heartache of heartaches, THEY HAVE CHANGED THEIR FALAFEL recipe. Their old-school falafel patty, which was basically an angel sent from heaven in chickpea patty form is now a less flavorful, balled, ugly stepsister version of the original. Makes my soul cry :'( It's still alright, but I long for the days of yore when the Scottish owner chef-guy made them from scratch.REST IN POWER FALAFEL PATTY.Still love the place as always. They've got a rotation of new lovely servers and service has gone up just enough for me to not find any issues. Yes, it's still a little slow at times, but I was there for over 3 hours sipping away and studying and I was impressed that I was checked up on a few times (huge difference from before.) The one server who had given me a touch of attitude is now gone and it's softened the vibe visibly. It was really lively on the Sunday afternoon I visited, a huge ASL group took up the front space signing away with vigor, to the right of me, a nuclear family quietly enjoyed tea, while university students kept the back jumping.I live down the road from here and basically use Bampot as my second home.

The tea selection is astounding, and the ""posh crackers and cheese"" make a nice snack, too.

Very chill atmosphere and the moroccon mint tea I had was lovely. They have an extensive tea list so there is sure to be something for everyone. My date had a salad which he said was fine and I had the daily curry which was a lentil sweet potato curry. The curry was decent but the pita that it came with was the star for me, it was chewy with raisins that was a sweet contrast to the curry. Overall, I really liked the atmosphere and after 9ish it started getting quite packed. I would definitely come back for a visit!

They opened two weeks ago and I've already been a few times. Amazing tea selection, really wonderful and comfortable decor, and a huge selection of board games. The games are also sorted by type, and there's a detailed list included with the menu to help you choose (it lists the time to play and number of players). The service is friendly, the prices reasonable, and, again, the tea selection impressive. Highly recomend.

I love the Bam Bam Chai and all their desserts! (We once got the Sweet Treat platter and every single thing was DELICIOUS.) I also love the Ballad Salad, the falafels, and their delicious raisin pita! The specials are usually great, but the one time I didn't like it, they took it back and didn't charge me for it.The board game selection is really great and often the management will come back and check out what we're playing and see how we like it. The only downside is the service can be pretty hit or miss. I'm not sure if this is because we normally sit in the back, but we often have to hunt someone down to make an order and sometimes the we'll get a dessert before our main! haha. If you have a lazy afternoon to play board games with your friends, this is the best place!

I was definitely not disappointed... This is simply the most adorable tea house ever, with very friendly staff. They have an incredible tea selection. I especially like their Fairies' Blood: the name picked my curiosity, and the drink did not let me down! They have great food, and very fair prices. It is all vegetarian, with GF and vegan options, and some items can be made GF and/or vegan as well. Game selection is great too. It's also a great place to read/knit/smoke shisha as well, and it's very cozy.I think it's fair to say I'll be a regular here... And the owners can probably already tell! I'd give this place more than 5 stars if I could!!!

Great customer service. The place is owned by a Scot man who wears his kilt proudly. When I came in the place on a Tuesday night, it was full. Understandable as it's a unique tea house. I can see why people come there just to read and hang. I'll probably not be returning though as the quality and tea making technique was not very high. Whether one chooses a Chinese, Indian or Russian tea etc, it's all brewed in a largish pot and served in a bowl cup. Blasphemy! I therefore await camellia sinensis to branch out from Montreal and show Toronto how to best showcase various teas. Till then I guess I won't be drinking tea out in Toronto

I also really like the neo-Moroccan decor which divides the place into a variety of cozy nooks and the board games are a nice touch (though they could branch out into more ""hardcore"" board games) and the relaxed, friendly atmosphere. Wish I hadn't eaten lunch before arriving so I could tell you about the food..."

Is that the word to describe it? Was a bit taken back at the fact you have to take your shoes off at this place. Interesting atmosphere, people bringing their own instruments to play or maybe were they there from the place for people to use, Im not sure. Little cubby hole seatings, a seat for one or larger groups, places by the window that have no seating just a raised platform with rugs to sit on with low tables for your food. Note books for people to randomly leave their mark and for you to read or view the art left by others. The crowd I would describe was quite ""earthy"". Almost like walking into a different zone all together. However, once I got over that and had their healthy food. Oh it was pretty tasty. Looked and was pretty simple meals but surprisingly there was some goood flavor in it too! And to know you are eating healthy - well done Bampot! Had the hummus and salad. But the pitas almost tasted like they were home made (maybe they were I didnt ask) and the salad dressing?! I asked what was in it but really they should just bottle that up and sell it. The tea I chose was a miss sorry to say. I think it was a chai base and apple or something I forget (was a month ago). My friend's mango one apparently was very tasty!Only thing, the tea did not seem too hot when it came out.The waitress got some things off, as my friend had to wait exceptionally long for her poutine soup - which they got mixed up with another dish and only told us until we questioned the long wait (my other friends were hungry and already almost finished their meal before my other friend got hers) and by that time she just changed it to the carrot soup which was already available. You do have to be open minded about the eclectic earthy hippy atmosphere and who ever you bring should be like that too. Well I am not much of a bohemian, the service is questionable at times, but Im interested in teas and healthy food that tastes good!"

I really enjoyed my experience here. Some reviews on here mentioned slow/bad service but that wasn't the case for me at all. I will admit though that some of the charm for me relies on nostalgia. It reminds me of growing up in the early 90s and being carefree while playing board games. The bohemian decor certainly helped as well.

They also take reservations which is great for parties .

Sort of a hippie version of snakes and lattes.  They already have a decent collection of games although it Just opened, so expect even more.  Keep an eye out for the Scottish chef! Food was great, i had a lentil soup and Pita with hummus.  Tea selection was phenomenal.

I've yet to try their Baklava. Their vegan cheesecake is superb. However, you don't go to Bampot to eat. You go there to enjoy one of their myriad of teas.TEAS: Bampot offers some of the best selection of teas in the GTA IMHO. My all-time favourite is the Desi Chai (Indian Masala Chai). It's creamy and flavourful. A pot for one person was enough for 3-4 cups. I was impressed. Whatever kind of tea you like, you will find it at Bampot.SERVICE: The service was courteous and friendly. Your waiter will be happy to advise you on the best tea according to your preferences.AMBIANCE: This place is not your typical cosmopolitan, hipster-ish tea house. It feels more hippy-ish, more relaxed, more communal, than commercial. It's a gathering spot for all kinds of people who come to Bampot to have a good time. Bampot is not for those seeking the next ""hot"" coffee / tea house in the neighbourhood. It's for those who want to enjoy a cup of good tea and have a relaxed conversation with their friend or partner.I know I'll be back at Bampot soon for another teapot of Desi Chai."

There's a dining room in the back but we were there early on a weeknight and the only customers were in the bar in front.  It was pretty full of mostly regulars. My wife's hamburger was apparently made from a preformed frozen party. I had the chicken pita which had a lot of chicken, along with onion and mushroom but was bland.  It would have benefited from less chicken and the addition of a sauce.  Service was efficient and friendly. If we lived closer we would drop by again, since it was cheap and clean and seems like on ok place to watch a game.  We live closer to river city grill which is a similar place but with a bit better food.

It's a family owned bar that draws in a great crowd which ranges from all ages and professions. The food is always delicious, the prices are very reasonable, and there is plenty of parking.If you haven't been there before let me save you the trouble of finding your way into the place. The front of the bar faces the main road but the front door doesn't open, you have to enter from the side of the building.One thing you'll notice is that it's a small building. The bar can fill up quickly around happy hour, however I've always been able to find a seat, plus they have plenty of tables to accommodate a large crowd. They have a nice patio on the side of the building which includes a roof top for when it rains, outdoor TV's so you can have a smoke and not miss the game, and heaters for winter time.I don't believe they are open earlier in the day, so count out stopping here for lunch. Overall it's a very nice bar! Let me rephrase that, it's a nice PUB! What's the difference? A bar is a place you go to drink, but a pub provides a social atmosphere that makes each visit fun. I recommend coming here if you're looking have a couple beers with a friend after work, or if you'd like to catch an Indians game.

There was ample parking in the back, and there were plenty of cars there, so we figured it must be decent if there was a crowd on a weeknight. It isn't a huge place, but the bar is pretty big and it looked like a great place to watch a game. The bartender Sam introduced himself to us and was very friendly and helpful. The walls are covered in sports memorabilia and bar signs. It's a very local ""dive"" style bar, but in a good way. Everything was super clean. They had $1.50 domestics, and the tall draughts were $3.50. They give you a brand new iced mug with every beer, which makes such a big difference. Their food menu is pub fare, and the prices are incredibly reasonable. We got their $2 burger special. It was a quarter pounder and came on a nice bun that was slightly toasted and had lettuce onion and pickles, cheese was an extra .30 cents. The sauerkraut balls were tasty as well. I was checking out some of the other food items that people sitting near us at the bar were getting and everything looked really good. The bartender Sam said they're known for their wings, I'll definitely be back to try them soon."

It was really a fun spot we had a great time the regulars were friendly and we felt quite comfortable here. I did order the pork belly ramen to go and it was a little salty but the porkbelly was so good. We will definitely be back to play Some games and the jukebox.Nice experience with this spot.

A late kitchen for other industry workers is always a huge plus. The bar was busy, but my friend and I opted for a table, instead. A server came over right away to give us water and to greet us, but to also let us know that any orders we make, had to be made through the bar, which was fine and we understood because my friend and I are both servers and bartenders. We did not try any of the beers or cocktails.My friend ordered the pork belly skewers, which he thought were great, and he also ordered ramen as an entree, which he told me was just okay. Having moved to Cleveland from Florida, I was very excited to see ceviche bowls offered on the menu for the spring and summer. I ordered the California ceviche bowl, which comes with white rice, avocado, scallions, tilapia, corn, and tomato salsa. I knew I was ordering cold fish and salsa with warm rice, but it just didn't meld well as expected and like other hot/cold combinations I had tried in the past. The rice seemed to have been sitting out for a while because it seemed to have gotten hard and crunchy. I didn't taste anything really stereotypically ""ceviche"" about the fish... no taste of lime or any citrus or any use of peppers, but I'll give it a pass because I still thought it tasted okay. What I had the biggest issue with, however, was the tomato salsa they used. It straight up tasted like marinara sauce poured over rice. I get that it was not listed as a spicy dish, but even a mild salsa has more taste than a standard marinara sauce. I looked longingly at the sriracha on the table and thought this dish would have tasted so much better omitting the tomato salsa and replacing it with sriracha, but alas, the damage was done.  Overall, I'd come back to this place for the cocktails and to enjoy the very awesome atmosphere at the bar, but I don't think I'll be trying their food again."

We're so happy it took the place of Bonnie & Clyde's--which was smelly, dark, and overall not a place I ever wanted to be unless I was inebriated already. But Yuzu is a completely different vibe. Lots of seating, both bar space and a dining room, nice lighting (not too dark), and the music was at the perfect volume (perfect for having conversations without having to yell). Basically, it's a great place to come have a few drinks and sit and talk with friends. Definitely not the kind of bar to get wasted at (checkout the bar next door for that).  As for the drinks, Yuzu really gets it right! The cocktail menu is extensive and we had a really hard time deciding what to try. We ended up going with 3 am Snap Stories, Florida Georgia Lime, and Gojira. Totally recommend all of them, but my favorite was 3 am Snap Stories. It's a tropical drink and perfect for summer. Everything was priced really well, not too expensive for craft cocktails. Didn't try any food but we plan to go back and change that. Someone next to us got the fries which looked and smelled so good. And everything else we saw coming out of the kitchen looked and smelled good as well. The bar staff was really friendly and very attentive. They were really helpful when we had questions about the drinks. Our favorite bartender from B&C's was there serving too, which was cool. If you're looking for a place in Lakewood to have some good food, drinks, and chill with friends then definitely check out Yuzu!

The drinks have fun names (""Thrift Store"") and novel concepts. There are happy hour specials every day.

I went there twice in the span of 3 days and was not disappointed. The portions are manageable and reasonably-priced, and they have options for all dietary needs, along with phenomenal cocktails. Their menu is quirky and you can't necessarily pinpoint what kind of cuisine it is, but that's what makes it so interesting! The only quip I'd have is that they seem under-staffed, albeit with extremely friendly waiters/waitresses. I went there along with a group of 15, when they only had 2 servers, and they still took care of us in a kind and methodical fashion.

Ordered 2 different bowls, the Korean Beef and Thai Beef and both were so-so.. Wouldn't order either of those again. And the portions are small... Get what ya pay for, I suppose. Will probably try Yuzu again & next time time dine in & try the drinks. Definitely wouldn't recommend take-out, though, at least not the bowls we ordered.

There is not a single bad choice on the menu, between the interesting cocktails, skewered meats, and rice bowls, everything we tried was quite honestly fantastic!  Not only that, but the waitstaff was so friendly and welcoming.  They wanted us to know we could bring our dog (if we had one) to hang out on their outdoor patio.  They even had a dog menu that included a dog bone flight.  Adorable!  Make a date to stop in here, for sure.

I loved the Cranberry Beer and the Kings Cream Ale.  For 6 bucks I got  Panko crusted fries with chives and cucumber sauce.  Also a skewer of chicken and the beer!  My friend had a rice bowl with mango, avocado, black beans and corn in a light cucumber sauce.  Free appetiser was endamine-soybean pod with cinnamon and paprika.  Not too bad but was in the pod and the of was too chewy but the bean was great!  Not too bad for 6 bucks!  Rice bowls are 7 .

And not like pineapple upside down shots. Interesting shots that come in pairs or trios with a chaser and interesting flavor combination. It's impossible to go and not order one. I had one that was tobacco whiskey chased with hazelnut cold press coffee. It was strong but delicious. Definitely recommend an evening on the patio.

Tried the chicken teriyaki - half off on Tuesdays - pretty good. I also tried yuzu fries with a wasabi sauce, which was delicious. There is a fairly lengthy beer menu, didn't see any japanese beers, which was surprising, maybe those are normally on tap (tap was being repaired). I tried a blood orange IPA bottle, really good. Also tried the Gojira cocktail - loved it! Very strong, definitely recommend. Drinks and food are not expensive at all - good value. Nice staff, our waitress was very friendly and made an effort to check on us often. Will be back next time with my doggie - they allow dogs on patio!!!

Having never been there, we were impressed with the inviting atmosphere.The menu had many interesting choices. The food was outstanding. I had a beef rice bowl. The meat was tender, juicy and spiced just right.  The portion was generous for the price.  Instead of having a cocktail, we each had sake. The glasses of sake were larger than I expected (darn). If you want a nice evening out, Yuzu is a wonderful choice.

I got the Blueberry Yum Yum & my husband got the ""Thrift Store"" - a bottle of beer served in a brown bag with a shot of the bartender's choice. The whole experience was fun. As we were waiting for our food we played checkers (they have a corner with a bunch of board games). We started with the edamame which was BOMB. Not that edamame is hard to mess up but it had this amazing seasoning on it. Then we both got the chicken tandoori skewers which were incredible. The dipping sauce was great. For entrée I got the vegetable ramen and he got the chicken rice bowl. The ramen noodles were some of the best I've ever had. I ended up actually having to share my bowl with my husband he loved them so much. I liked his chicken bowl but he wasn't a big fan because he said the chicken was too chewy (I thought it was fine). We finished off with a glass of sake!!"

When walking in the dining room it  was full and so was the bar besides two seats. The menu had alot of interesting drinks and creative names. Will have to try the next time if i come back! As for the food my boyfriend and I were not too impressed. We tried a few different types of skewers. ( Chicken/Fried chicken/and some other one i forgot) plus the yuzu fries.The skewers were honestly nothing crazy and Im pretty sure we finished them in less than 5 mins they were pretty small. They werent expensive just not filling at all. So i guess they are good for a snack?  The yuzu fries on the other hand, I would come back for. The sauce on them was sooooo good. I was expecting a little bit more out of this place but maybe I will just have to give it another chance one day.

I must say that Yuzu was a wonderful, warm reprieve from the blustery night.The bar was fairly crowded so my friend and I grabbed a seat in the dining space where there was ample seating.  First and foremost, the beer and cocktail menu is not only beautifully curated, but hilarious and witty with on-trend references like the 3am Snap Story cocktail.  I had a Platform Xmas ale which was one of the best Christmas ales I've tried.   As far as the food goes... I was able to try the food at a previous Yelp event and I'm drooling over the fries right now. They offer tasty, unique bites that they serve until late which is a nice option over the usual 24-hour diner fare.  Staff is friendly and accommodating. Additionally, they are always hosting clever events like The Oregon Trail bar crawl.While I was there, some guy at the bar bought the whole house of 20+ people a round of shots. That's the kind of place Yuzu is.  It's warm, it's friendly, it's unpretentious.  It's your new Cheers. Grab a friend and go here for a great beer or cocktail, conversation and some tasty late night bites. You won't be disappointed.

Who would suspect that this small local joint would be so good and delicious!The atmosphere is laid back. The outdoor patio is awesome.  Nice view of the sky (sunset) and some trees for shading. Dogs welcome!!The wait staff was very efficient and super nice.  Down to earth. Attentive. Our food was delicious.  Wasabi fires very tasty, not super hot - so don't be scared off.Edamame beans?  I think that's what they were called. So very good and natural. Just theright dusting of salt and spice. Skewered chicken and rice with roasted vegetables. Again, a wonderful blend of taste. I just stuck with the local beers.  But they had a list, I'll check out next time.  Overall, it is not overly priced. Too many spots in Lakewood are getting hoyty-toyty and upper - crusted over. Know what I mean?  We just want a nice place to hang out with good food that isn't always typical bar food. And decent beer prices with a choice if we want something better than average. There was also a DJ. Not sure what type of music is usually played. But it was a little to hard for me - no metal please.

Yuzu has a unique atmosphere with a creative cocktail and food menu.  Teriyaki tuesdays are my favorite, the Yuzu fries are delicious.  They have a great selection of beers.  Prices are great. I cannot wait to try the Charlie Kelly cocktail next.

The prices are very good and portion sizes are smaller but filling for sure. This place has board games and a fun menu for cocktails and offers a pet friendly environment, great place to eat.

Drinks were good (ok maybe could have been a little colder, and we learned we had to have martinis in tumblers because they ""only had one martini glass"" -- but hey! they're just getting started). Food was really good -- the bowls tasted like homemade cooking--in a good way, meaning healthy, tasty, satisfying, and homey--but all with an inventive twist. I really appreciate having not one but two vegan options -- and they were very accommodating, even bringing out an extra side of fries when we realized the (delicious!) sauce on the fries might not be vegan. And speaking of the fries -- they were so good! VERY hot which is just how you want fries to come out. In terms of service, our server was so nice, the owner personally visited our table and delivered our food, and the back patio was spacious. And they allow dogs and have a dog menu. Looking forward to going back with my human and canine friends."

The vibe was very chill and the drinks were VERY stiff--you know, the one and done kind of drink. It took the server a while to get to my table, but I wasn't in a hurry. After placing our order, the drinks and appetizer (yuzu fries!) came quickly. The entrees (vegan Buddha bowl, Bourbon chicken bowl) came out about halfway through the appetizer; perfect timing imho. Our server was pleasant and attentive, yet not over the top. One thing I think would make this place a little better, is if tofu/seitan/tempeh was available as a protein for vegan/vegetarian dishes. But overall, this place was great!So, if you are into late 90s-early 2000s punk music and yummy rice bowls, this is the place for you.

Despite being very obviously Japanese-inspired (decor, origami instructions on the coasters, descriptions of Japanese terms on the menu), the staff responded as if offended when my friend asked for chopsticks with her teriyaki rice bowl. My yakitori was tasty, but despite getting two different skewers, they tasted very much the same. So much so I'm a little convinced that they mis-made my order. I was also missing any hint of potato with my fried chicken skewer (a misnomer, since both of my skewers where fried chicken), despite it being in the description. My vegetable skewer (which was actually still chicken?) came with the same small side of veggies as the fried chicken skewer.The portions are also extremely small. Despite spending over $7 on my 2 skewers, I left Yuzu pretty hungry.

I ordered the chicken thigh skewer. The chicken was moist and tender. The prices are very reasonable so it was fun to try different combinations. Kelly the bartender was very helpful and funny.

So happy we did!!!!  Loved this place!  We had the Thai fries (half order was plenty to share), they were the best fries I have ever had!  My husband had the Korean Beef Bowl and I had the Thai Beef bowl...both were excellent!  The bowls look small but they seemed bottomless, we brought both of our dinners home!  We will definitively be back!  We also had a dirty martini each...loved their drink names but were a little too sweet for our taste.  Our total bill was $37, couldn't believe it for all the food we had!  Excellent service as well!!!!

Really enjoyed the place, service and food. The cocktails are exotic and a variety that I haven't seen in other places. The skewers and bowls range from savory to sweet. I had the chicken skewers, Yuzu fries and beef bowl. All A+The size and price of the food is like tapas. Two or three skewers, bowl and app make a great meal. Some ""tapas"" restaurants have huge portions and steep prices - yuzu's are just right . Here the orders are perfect to share a few bites. Even though it is a new restaurant the service and flow were excellent. All the service staff were friendly and welcoming.Now for another secret if you've made it this far in the review. The backyard patio is a secluded hideaway. Maybe six tables surrounded by a high fence and pine trees. Lakewood doesn't have enough outdoor dining options and Yuzu has one of the best."

The vibe is so great and the food is amazing!!  We love the extensive beer options and unique descriptions, they always make me laugh out loud :)  The service is always above and beyond and the food is affordable and never disappoints!  The rice bowls are my favorite! I love sitting on the patio and especially love that it is dog friendly and our pups have their own menu! Dog Beer?  Yes!! :)  If you are ever in the Lakewood area, make sure to try this awesome new spot, you will not be disappointed!

I still standby my previous review-- the food is awesome and I love the skewers. Also, they have one of the most pun-y and fantastic drink menus ever (the 3am Snap Story, #basicbitch Iced Coffee, Straight Outta Pinterest... to name a few).Now that i've had a chance to experience Yuzu more often, I adore it. Portlandia Patio Party? Crazy Cat Lady night? 90's Girls Only Sleepover Party? Yuzu infuses the fun back into the neighborhood with their hilarious and original events. Not to mention, the staff at Yuzu are just totally lovely people. They care about your experience and are dedicated to the neighborhood in an incredibly authentic way. I just love to give a giant, virtual high five to anyone creative enough to program a restaurant with such awesome, fun things to do year-round, while also having great service and unique food.

The environment is a typical dive bar, nothing flashy, but it's a comfortable spot to come and relax. Did I mention the food?In fairness, I've only tried two dishes, both five dollar specials. This is a great deal, maybe even a steal for the amount of food you receive.I tried the gluten free veggie ramen. The noddles were tasty, not overdone. The egg complemented the broth and vegetables, and it warmed me up on a cold night. I basically plan on coming back and trying everything else on the menu. I also keep meaning Tj hit up one of their trivia nights. They have really fun themes here. Overall whoever runs this place has my full approval.

An izakaya isn't merely a bar serving Japanese food, as there are many bars in Japan that serve food and aren't considered izakayas. An izakaya is more akin to a Japanese TAPAS bar, which has a wide variety of appetizers and small bites to choose from. Yuzu has a small sampling of appetizers, but the menu items are mostly standard and so I'd consider it more just an Asian fusion bar.The atmosphere was nice, and the staff were very friendly and accommodating. The food was ok - my friend got the Korean beef rice bowl, which the menu admits to using ""cheater"" bulgogi. The beef was ground up, whereas bulgogi is more in thin slices. The flavor was not too bad, though it was the type of dish I could get at almost any restaurant. I personally got the ahi tuna poke, because poke has been on the rise in the States and I have been trying to sample poke everywhere. While the colors and presentation were solid, the flavor was not to par. The tuna was very tough to chew and did not taste particularly fresh. When I have poke, I typically anticipate that the tuna has been marinated in various sauces for a fairly long time, but this dish tasted like the sauce was recently added on. I also felt like there was not enough sauce in general. Additionally, the mangoes and avocado seemed to stand in contrast to the fish rather than complement it.I do enjoy the atmosphere at Yuzu, and the staff were extraordinarily friendly. However, I think the food could use some work in terms of flavor."

They are constantly putting on different events with different themes. They even have dinners that you can bring your dog to and they bring your furry friend their own doggy meal. Their drinks all have clever names and they have shot and beer combos for when you're feeling adventurous. When it comes to the food, you just can't beat their delicious bowls. I have also tried the yuzu fries, which were definitely not what I expected, but so delicious. The patio is small, but a nice place to sit when the weather is nice enough. They also have a nice selection of board games if you need a little something different to spice up your night! My one complaint is that whenever I've visited, the music has been almost alarmingly loud. Overall, it's definitely a great place to try when you're looking for something a little out of the or

I wanted to treat myself to their fried cauliflower. I placed my order for pick up. Staff and patrons were friendly. When I got home and opened the order they had given me chicken instead of cauliflower. I called back and they were more than happy to fix the issue. I went back and the remake was wonderful. Four out of five because we didn't get it first time, but immediately and properly fixed the situation.

Yuzu is always a good place to go, and we find ourselves heading there more nights than not. The drinks are all creative, delicious, and constantly rotating. The bartenders are friendly as well. Food is delicious as well. It's much better and more unique than your classic bar food. I absolutely love the Yuzu fries. Whatever is in the sauce on top is magical (kind of like a garlic-y horseradish-y aioli). I also really like their vegetable Ramen. The vegetables are fresh and the broth is flavorful. Definitely, check them out on a theme night or trivia night. We've gone to Parks and Rec trivia, Chardee MacDennis, and a few others, and always have a good time.

Just what I've been looking for! The menu is confusing at first, it's not explained well. On the bar side it's totally divey vibe, they were playing kill bill two omg so obsessed! Thursday is $5 ramen night, vegetarian or beef, I got the beef it was so good. Then I got the yuzu box (aka bento box) the novelty of it is hysterical, adorable and delicious. They serve it with a cream ale ""little kings"". Their beer selection is so diverse, and their happy hour 4 to 6 is great. The moshi moshi mule is $3! Where do you ever see a Moscow mule type drink for $3?? I will be back here next week with my bf so he can experience the joy as well."

Fries chicken was crispy and good. Not what I expected for Korean fried chicken, it came with dipping sauce that taste like duck sauce. We didn't like the ramen, the broth was sweet. Not sure about that. Pork belly was good though. It's a good place for late night snacks and drinks and games.

Where else can you get shots that come with a toy?  In all seriousness, Yuzu is a really cool spot where you can get small plates and good drinks with even better service.  The butabara skewers and carnivore ramen are where it's at.  All the drinks have funny names and are tasty.  Feliz Cajita's are amazing and the Resting Bitch Face are some of my favorite drinks.Next is the service.  I have never, ever had bad service here.  All of the bartenders are absolutely amazing.

I ended up ordering delivery through UberEats. First, it was quick. Took about 30-35 minutes, which is less than most pizza delivery. I ordered a Korean bulgogi bowl, Thai steak bowl, the Yuzu fries and a child's chicken teriyaki and pb&j skewer. My Thai bowl was REALLY good. There was a sufficient kick from the fresh ginger (but I'm a wimp when it comes to spice). I also tasted my husband's Korean bowl. It was really good, but, it didn't taste like any bulgogi I've ever had. Again, however, it was so good that I'd order it again. I tasted my kids' chicken teriyaki and I appreciated that it tasted like -real- chicken teriyaki. My kids generally eat kid sized portions of adult food so I love places that offer that. The prices are super reasonable. At first glance, the portion was small but I was satiated. I'll definitely return.

I got the bento box with fried cauliflower and veggie ramen. Bento box came out in a Styrofoam take out container which I thought was a bit odd. The ""dessert"" was chocolate chips, in a little plastic sauce container, also odd. Overall not bad, the Wasabi aoli was pretty good.The ramen, overall, was pretty good. This actually came in a real bowl, but the bowl was pretty small. Would have been nice to have more soup, I mean that's the point of ramen right?? The noodles themselves were pretty reasonable cooked although not perfect. The flavor was pretty damn good, though beans in ramen was a little odd. My friend got one of the rice bowls, which was pretty good, although it did have a sort of odd flavor or spice to it.The drinks were delicious though! Only good things to say there.So I'll definitely be back, but won't hold my expectations very high. From reading other reviews, seems like the quality can be inconsistent. Not sure what's happening in their kitchen, but if they can get their consistency better then it has the potential to be great."

If I could give 3.5 stars/borderline 3.25, I would. I wanted to love this place.  The drinks are awesome. We will definitely come back for drinks! The food and service was just lackluster. The avocado bowl was primarily rice which had little to no flavor. The vegetable skewers were very tasty, the potato being the best part. We sat at the bar, and we were 2 of 4 people in the restaurant at that day but the server did not seem to want to really be there-which I understand, we've all had our off days but with the restaurant still being new, some friendliness and a smile would have gone a long way for sure.  Well will go back because like I said, the drinks are awesome bit I'm hoping they can fine tune the food menu, add a few more vegetarian choices and some more flavor and maybe have some happy shiny faces :)

The owner of this establishment looks like Aidy Briant from SNL. The service is great and the employees are very friendly . They offer you a sample cups when soon as you walk in, you don't even have to ask. I love the decor in the bright pink and green colors! TCBY is a great fit in Davidson even though I will always miss Red Mango!Happy Froyodling!

The TCBY recently opened on Saturday and are cranking out the usual frozen yogurt bar with all the fixins. While I can't compare it to Red Mango (since I never went), I can say that this TCBY was quite impressive.The interior is super bright and clean, most probably since the store just opened. There are a few interior tables as well as two outside that were pretty comfortable. The guy behind the counter was nice and gave my sister a few tasting cups so she could try the flavors before deciding what to plop into her bowl. They had a about ten flavors to choose from, and I really enjoyed the bananas foster. What was really cool was they had a cookies & cream flavor next to a salted caramel, so you were able to twist the two together. A salty, caramely cookies & cream was an amazing flavor combination!Of course, when I look at these yogurt bars I look to the toppings, and I was impressed with the selection that this TCBY had. There were a lot of fresh fruit options, and that's what I like. I loaded up on mangos, peaches, strawberries, kiwis and blueberries, and left behind the pineapple, orange and some other stuff. They did have the jelly-like bobas that are weird to me. I was introduced to mochi, which is a rice thingy that is very similar to marshmallow, and will now become a staple on all of my future frozen yogurt concoctions. There was also plenty of the ""junk food"" toppings like chocolate chips, syrups, candies and other stuff.The price seemed about right, as our two frozen yogurt bowls came out to $7 and change. With a appealing interior and awesome topping selection, I see us coming back here."

Excellent Sangria (Blackberry a favorite) We have had nearly 100% superb waitstaff, friendly and accomodating. It can get confusing because as the food is ready, other waitstaff may bring to the table...so you often see multiple people in a short time. Love the lasagna, very generous portions, And the House salad is always fresh and the Parmesan dressing wonderful. Chicken Bryan, Lobster MacNCheese, and a seasonal pork medallions with a fig sauce all excellent.Wish they had  Apple Crostada year round---kind of like a free form apple pie but so much more...And please keep the mini desserts on the menu year round. they are perfect size!

Most of the time, the service is good.  Upon arriving tonight, we asked to sit in the bar but the hostess offered to seat us either at the bar itself or at a high table, citing something about a rotation.  Fortunately, the manager, Brett, interrupted stating ""they can sit wherever they want"", and we were seated in a booth in the bar, as we originally requested.The food was good, as always, as was the service from Ashley, who was also the bartender.  Throughout the meal, Brett stopped by a few times to ensure everything was to our liking.  This extra attention certainly wasn't expected, but it was definitely appreciated."

Our food was just alright, it was hot and cooked properly, but nothing was really that great that we wanted to ever go back.  We got the chicken marsala and the prosciutto wrapped shrimp and they were both  underwhelming.  The bruschetta we got was also just okay and nothing that I will ever crave to go back to.

Only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because they were out of salmon, and although extremely delicious, our Lemoncello bread pudding was awfully small in portion for being $8. Also, it was served in an extremely hot skillet which made the ice cream melt super quick, but the bread pudding was only warm in some places and actually cold, (like right out of the fridge), in other spots. All in all, a good dining experience though.

Good service, hot good food, relaxing time.OK, now for the meat of it. No pun intended.I arrived a tad late in the evening.  Fairly busy.  I asked for a table because I don't do booths.  I just don't.  The only tables they had were pulled together.  The hostess went out of their way to pull a table loose and set it up for me.I was quickly attended to by the server, Megan.  Top notch. I already had my choice made, a nice penne dish with the Italian salad.  The salad showed up about the same time my water did, which was very fast.Meagan brought me a couple of wine samples and I picked a nice cabernet.The penne came out at just the right time, piping hot and fresh. Megan made sure my water never went dry.  She was very attentive.When I finished the penne Megan gave me a run down of the deserts.  I had the seasonal panna cotta, cooked custard with raspberries.OK, I get it.  Chains are not always cool.  I much prefer local eateries, and the occasional dive.  But I like Carrabbas.  Their food is prepared the way I prepare things at home.Megan did an excellent job.  If you have the opportunity to go to Carrabas be sure and ask for her and tell her Bud recommended her.

We ordered the Mac N Chz burger and a turkey burger version of the Carolina burger. A regular next to us suggested as I ordered to get the sauce on the side. This was helpful and made it enjoyable to eat. We both had our fries crispy because that's how we like em. We were delighted by the shoe string truffle fries. They were crispy and flavorful. The service was average Friday night timing and the owner touched base to see how we were. The lighting is romantic, the atmosphere a quiet roar and the price point on par for the items being served.

The waiter was friendly but somewhat unattentive and tried to push the other restaurants/deli on to us quite a bit. The food was pretty mediocre but edible..no complaints. I'm not a huge string fry fan so I was hoping for some thicker cut ""chips"". The blueberry bread pudding was okay. It tasted like they used old garlic bread from the other restaurant next door then smothered it in whiskey and butter. We went about 15-20 minutes without a water refill and waited 10 minutes for our card to be picked up. All in all it was just okay but at least now we know and it only cost us $30. I guess that's what Restaurant Week is all about though right?"

Myrah and Joe were great to work with and everything exceeded my expectations. They have a buyout package, so we had the restaurant to ourselves for the evening, and Myrah was great working with our DJ and photo booth and ensuring everything would work for the night of. I arrived before the event started and it being my first visit to charr, I was very impressed with the atmosphere and the staff was working hard to make sure everything looked great. They provided a buffet dinner and the bar was available to employees. Once it got dark, they lit the fire pits on the patio and it had a nice, warm feeling to it. I would definitely recommend them for a private party for a large group (we had about 60 attendees). The only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is because the food was from Aiello's (their sister restaurant), so I can't speak to the food at charr's. But I will definitely return and recommend them based on the service they provided last night and throughout the planning process.

Its hard to beat that price, so we thought we'd give it a shot. I'm glad we did! We both got the Charr burger, and it was great. The meat was cooked perfectly, and I like how they give you one big, thick burger instead of two small ones. The pretzel bun was also good, but could have been pretzel-ier. I wanted to try the turkey burger, but since the $5 special only applied to the Charr burger, I had regular beef. But next time I go back, and I will go back, then I will pay full price and try something else.

I had the Arizona burger.  The bun was burnt stiff on one side and the burger, and while good in theory, was ok at best.  Definitely could have done better.  I just don't understand why these places try and get fancy and butcher an American classic.  I don't need a fancy bun, especially if it's burnt, and if you aren't going to season the meat, at least make up for it in other areas.  The fries and southwest sauce was pretty good though.On another note, there was a cold seafood bar near the kitchen, so I'm not even sure what theme they are going for here.  I can get surf and turf somewhere else, not at a burger joint.If I lived close, I would give it another try, but don't expect it to blow you away.  Just another trendy burger joint in my honest opinion.

I have been enjoying the patio with my dogs for years! Whenever I have friends or family in town we always go to Charr. Occasionally we'll see the roadrunner make an appearance on the patio. Joe, the owner, runs a phenomenal three restaurants! It's obvious the staff are happy, appreciated and love what they do. The truffle fries are to die for and when you're craving a dessert and adult beverage you can kill two birds with one stone. I have recommended Charr to many people over the years and will continue to!

The restaurant is really cool and appealing to the eye. The food is really really good. I have had the buffalo chicken sandwich and on this trip I had the Carolina burger. The fresh handmade garlic bun is an awesome addition to any burger. I have zero complaints as far as food goes.  Food gets 4 stars. My issue with this place is the service, or lack there of. Upon arrival there were two other tables that were occupied. It still took 10 minutes to get a drink. 15-20 minutes after that we got to order food. The food arrived after a reasonable amount of time. I felt like I wanted to pay my bill at that time so we could leave in a timely manner and not be held bill captive.  Service gets 2 stars. I want this place to survive because it is a local business with great food. Service issue needs to be resolved to reflect the price point of food. There are a million places to go get a $12.00 entree and a $5.00 beer, give me a reason to want to spend my money here.

The good: revamped Market Bistro space is attractive and the bar selection solid. The burgers were very good and the garlic knots they're served on, equally delicious. The portions were fair - that is not overly generous or skimpy - and the food was fresh. Service was prompt and hostesses polite. Owner came through twice to ask about our experience. Prices are okay. The not so good: We were put at a table that did not have proper clearance between us and the next table on one side and a booth on the other. It meant that a large woman's stomach met my back as she passed through. Mmmm blech. Wait staff frequently hit the chair. I moved to the other side which meant that no one could get through there but it moved traffic around the two tables. Music, although nice, was too loud. For the number of families we saw in there, this does not read as kid friendly. I have a 10 year old for whom we ordered sliders without the peppers and chipotle mayo and although we could've sprung for a milk shake [hello more sugar] water was about my only other option and bonus! free. Now, I'm not expecting the crayon greeting that we get at CPK, but it just didn't have the family vibe to me. Kiddo liked the burger and the brownie dessert [which came as described on the menu but without the whipped cream] and the lovely seconded the dessert thumbs up. My flat iron salad had freshly cut romaine, homemade croutons, some bermuda onion, corn and black beans and a slice of tomato that was cut in half. I asked for the dressing on the side. It came with a good portion of sliced flatiron steak that although cooked well, had zero seasoning and the dressing on the side was described as a southwest caesar. I didn't get southwest and I did get blah/lacking in flavor. Bottom line, we'd go back but for the burgers only. Cost of the meal for three of us with no drinks, only water, was $40. Its nice that its in the hood and that there is good food but overall it was good, not great.

The barbeque burger was Ok except the barbeque sauce was very sweet.  The server was good but was very touchy feely and kept calling me pet names like ""babe"" and ""sweetheart"" which made me uncomfortable since he was at least 15 years younger than I am."

We sat out front and waited for our waiter to take our drink orders... And waited... And waited.Nearly 10 minutes after we were seated, I try to flag someone down through the front window, and finally our waitress arrived and took our orders. She apologized for the delay, said something about how she had to train someone to enter food orders. It didn't seem exceptionally busy, so I think they just forgot we were seated. I thought this might be an isolated incident, but then I watched another man with a small child get seated near us a half hour later and end up leaving before a waitress ever arrived because the child couldn't wait any longer to eat... I see from the reviews other people have had similar experiences. Maybe the wait staff they're training will improve the service here, but it wasn't great when we went.The reason I am giving 3 stars is the food. The Carolina burger was delicious... The sauce and bacon were savory, the garlic knot bun was perfect. Their fries were great and they give you plenty of them.I'd recommend this place for the food, but expect to wait for it.

Multiple refills and check ins.The food did take a while, but not too long for a real burger and there was one guy in the kitchen doing everything. I could see straight into the kitchen and saw the guy wash his hands. I appreciate his proper hygiene.The food was very good and a good value at lunch menu prices.One kid got the battered chicken fingers, she got a nice pile. The other kid plate came with 2 nice sized sliders and fries.I am not a fan of truffle oil on fries and they get heavy handed with the truffle oil. Nobody else seemed to mind, just my personal taste. The sweet potato fries were good.

So festive with their Christmas decor.I went here for dinner on a Friday with a sorority sister because she had recommended it. It has a great location in morth Phoenix and hosts a beautiful fire pit fitted outisde patio, but was a little chilly for outside dining that night. We opted for a table in the middle of the place, my only complant was that I got the chair and my sister got the booth. In the chair, I felt like I was a foot above her and it was a little uncomfortable to sit that way.None the less, the service was fantastic. We each ordered drinks and were hand delivered by a nice bartender. We could see the hustle and bustle of the kitchen from our seats and with an open air kitchen like that it really fills the room with the right amount of noise. We got an app, friend zucnini with ranch dipping sauce. They were alright. I wish they had a bigger crunch when you bite in but they also cut really nicely for nibbling perfection. I got the The Buffalo Chicken while my sister orded the Grilled Chicken. Mine came with the most melty, amazing, mouth watering white cheese. That was my favorite part. The bread was great and the chicken too. Not enough buffalo sauce but the blue cheese dipping sauce was on point.The place is owned by the funny Italian guy and he was just hanging around the place. He speaks poor english but is super friendly and will always ask you how your meal was. I'd go back.

I only wish they were open and delivered at lunch time. The food is very good. I had the 5 cheese sandwich, a cheese lovers dream, and the housemade onion rings. I had ordered a diet coke which was flat. They could not fix it, so I just drank water. The wait staff was friendly, but kind of slow. I thought it was very, very pricey for what you get. The food was very good. I guess it comes down to what are you tradeoffs for good food?

Our server was great. LOTS of personality, friendly and took time with us, even with training a new server.  They were both attentive and kept our drinks full. I had the BBQ burger and it was great! Juicy, good toppings and not drenched in sauce. My buddy had the Charr burger ans said it was cooked well and very tasty. Actually heading back in a bit and wanted to let them know they are doing a great job!!

I had the Turkey Burger, which was delicious and easily altered as per my requests. Instead of fries, I ordered the grilled veggies, which were perfectly done. Our waitress, Claudia, was very professional and extremely attentive. (I am glad that we did not take those negative reviews below to heart. Instead, we gave Charr a chance to prove those reviewers wrong, and we are certainly glad it did.) We look forward to returning.

I can promise it will not be my last time.  I had the portabello burger( FABULOUS), the truffle fries are truly worth writing home about, and OMG, the blueberry bread pudding with whiskey sauce.  I literally needed to be rolled out of the door with left overs for tomorrow!  Happy tummy for 2 days!

My experience was all good. Stopped in for late lunch on a Sunday. We kept it pretty straightforward. I had a Charr Burger with Cheddar Cheese. It was nicely cooked to medium rare. My girlfriend opted for the Chicken Grill. Both turned out to be good choices. The garlic knot bun for the burger is unique and buttery good. The meat could have used a bit more seasoning, but still had good flavor. The truffle fries were an excellent companion piece to the whole meal.In the end, our waiter, Gino, was kind enough to give us some extra garlic knot buns to take home. Had a sandwich on one for dinner that night.The burger world is the crowded spot these days, but Charr does have a home in it.

We were not disappointed.From the hostess to the bartender to our waitress to Joe himself coming to chat with us, you feel like you are a regular at a restaurant that you've been going to for years. We were seated and ordered drinks, some alcoholic and some not, and all were good. The dirty Grey Goose martini was especially good. It's nice to find a place that will make it dirty when asked, instead of skimping on the olive juice. Always a plus for us is a strong, free wi-fi connection. Just ask your server for the password.For our appetizers, our table had the tomato bisque soup, onion rings, and the red fresno pepper poppers. The soup was very creamy and thick, and the goat cheese was a great added flavor. The poppers brought some extreme heat to the table. These aren't your wimpy Sonic jalapeno poppers. The onion cream cheese filling cut the heat a bit with a nice tang, but be warned, these things pack a punch! As to the onion rings, I won't call them a ""miss"", but they were just so-so after the other two great offerings.Various burgers were ordered along with some sandwiches. Everyone loved the obviously fresh-made garlic knot buns and fresh toppings. The sauteed crimini mushrooms and carmelized onions on my steak and blue sandwich were awesome. If you are a fan of the blue cheese, ask for extra. It was a little skimpy on my sandwich for my taste.We were offered the desserts (made by Joe) including bread pudding and an apple crumble, but we were all too full to try those. Definitely next time."

Just an FYI, the fries come with your burger and other sides come with the meal, so kudos to them for listening to the previous gripes and addressing them. I have been twice. I will be back again. It is a nice date spot, great dim atmosphere with some music, but you are able to carry on a conversation with ease.  And, like I noted before: lack of children.  The few I have seen were all well behaved and parentally managed.  The service was great both times, friendly, knowledgeable and attentive without hovering.Give it a try and you may discover a new jewel of an eatery!

First off, this place is in a strip mall - not the kind of place you expect to be asked ""do you have reservations?"" I think there is a little mismatch here. The decor is smart and clean, if a little bland. It screams ""American Bistro"" in a cookie-cutter manner. The good things? They have a raw bar and do oyster shots (which I found reasonably priced, too)! Their bar is denfinitely well-stocked and they have a select list of wines and local/ micro-brew beers and ales (San Tan Ale was my choice that evening and it didn't disappoint), the shots were served cold (Patron) with lime, but no one remembered the salt until it was requested (quibble if you will, but I do like salt and lime with most commercial tequila). The quality of the ingredients of the food is quite good, too. Now the bad part: It took over 35 minutes for my order to come out (a burger and fries, an oyseter shot) and when one of the people at the table asked for HER check (not ""the check""), we got everyone's tab on it! WHat a nightmare. The server, who had been inattentive or disorganized all night never got better (hint: you will improve your tips if you don't call the men ""buddy"" and ""bro"" and if you don't call the women ""sweetie."" Frankly, ""Sir"" and ""Ma'am"" work really well). And the burger was NOT rare, but to be fair, you really can't get a patty that thin to be rare and warm. Oh, and ""truffle fries?"" Meh. Truffle oil doesn't impress me, but the texture was right, not overcooked or undercooked with a nice crisp outside. The beef was tasty, but the patty surprisingly thin, even for a $10.00 burger.I'll go back, but I won't be in any hurry if I do and I'll ask for a different waitstaff if I get the same waiter. All in all, it seems like some of the staff could use a little more training in cadence and attentiveness but the food was pretty good.Oh, and lastly, the bathrooms in a place that is trying to be upscale should be in good repair - broken tp holders and a large unpainted patch job isn't consistent with the image this restaurant wants to project."

They use black Angus beef, have turkey burgers that are huge, and a black bean based veggie burger too. Gluten free buns are an option. You can have fries with white truffle oil or homemade mac-n-cheese. A side salad or sweet potato fries are a buck more, and homemade onion rings are a couple of bucks more, but are yummy. They have two slider options for appetizers where the garlic knot bun's are homemade. The chili wings are tasty. They have great portion salad options in case a burger is not what your wanting. The shakes are a great compliment. They have a few desserts. I had the warmed brownie with vanilla bean ice cream, whipped cream and more chocolate syrup on top. Did I mention they have a full bar, and many craft beers on tap. So many choices I did not list.

My husband and I were looking for a new casual dining place and happened to drive by Charr. We,went in on a Sunday evening and sat at the bar because they had all day happy hour. We ordered the spinach and artichoke dip as,an appetizer. It was Amazing! By the time our dinner came we were stuffed! My husband ordered a Buffalo Burger which was great and I had the chicken salad which was very flavorful. We left with 3 big to go boxes and,will be back soon.

They have a nice selection of beer on tap and a full bar. Salads are maybe a bit run of the mill. The wings are served with a sweet sticky sauce on them and my preference is a crisp fried wing with light sauce so I typically don't eat wings here. The service is friendly and if you go later in the evening (7:30-onward) it is more lively.

The menu is packed full of great options, salads, burgers, sandwiches and sides. It really was a tough decision with all the great choices but  I went with the Belly Buster fork burger and my boyfriend had The Phoenix burger. Delicious. It hit the spot, cooked the way I wanted. Complete with that charred taste. They came on Garlic Knot Buns, just a hint or garlic taste if any. With these buns we noticed that they are a much hardier type of bun that won't become soggy after sitting as easily. Sturdy yet soft. Butter lettuce, tomato, and onion served on the side. When they say ""smothered"" they mean it.   We found a good Burger joint without having to treck across to downtown phoenix or scottsdale for an overpriced burger. No reason to go else where now :)"

I first tasted their food at a Multiple Sclerosis Society event called Cooks & Chords. They were offering tastings to support the cause, and I wanted to support them after seeing their efforts. Absolutely loved the crabcake burger with tartar. Truffle fries are amazing, and wow the portions. Enough for dinner and lunch the next day. Service was top notch, very quick. Appetizers are awesome, I particularly liked the fried zucchini. Perfect spot for lunch or dinner when in Moon Valley. Must check out if you're in the neighborhood.

Try the steakhouse burger.. A burger covered in a smoked gouda cheese and mushrooms, slightly smothered in a yummy steak sauce, and topped off with some crispy onion strings.

You sit at the bar you get the specials. Really?  Server was good but did not refill the diet coke. The burgers are 1/2 pound so we shared. The Phoenix has jalapeños, cheddar, chipotle mayo, red onion, lettuce and tomato. Thin truffle fries, that are wonderful!  We shared and it was plenty and for a nice lunch discount!  The only thing wrong was the well done burger was WAY too done.  Nice if in the area!

We were customers of Aiello's when they were open (same Owners) and always had a great meal.Had the fish & chips & fries and it was great.  The fish was so mild and fresh and the breading was delicious...not over breaded.  My husband had the burger and I tasted it (of course) and agreed with him, that it was a winner.  The dessert we had was the blueberry bread pudding with whiskey sauce and it was a home run!!  Of course, the best part of the whole experience was Brian, who always took care of us at Aiello's and now is at Charr.  We will definitely be returning.....many times!!

Lots of food choices for a burger place. Especially tasty was the barbecue sauce and tuna on nicoise salad.

The burgers are outstanding. Tasty, creative, plenty of food for a grown man. The atmosphere is open with a slightly loud operational noise vibe. The service I had was great. The waitress and bar keep both went out of their way to take care of us. Remember its a two way street. A friend and I went for a late dinner and they let us close the place down without any hassle. Cant wait to go back for a more reasonably timed dinner soon.

Now, that's not to say it wasn't a decent burger, but are there burger joints that do it better? You bet! Hop Doddys and Rehab Burger both in Scottsdale, I think cook a slightly better burger. That being said, why did I rate Char a 4? The service is what kicks this place up a notch. Everyone is so welcoming, including the owner who is from NY and walks the dining room asking his customers how their meal was. Oh, and the fries were pretty good too. The only downsides so far are the burgers and the hostess who walks around like she's on Xanax. I mean, come on, if you're going to hire a hostess then hire one who has a bit more pep and enthusiasm. Honestly, she looked positively bored.

So we jump into the car and drove a bazillion miles to get here. The place definitely looked cool in person and it was well kept and clean.  The loo was pretty decent as well for a burger joint.  The staff were super friendly and helpful because this was our first time eating here.  Service was good speed, and no mistakes were made. To the food, Nicholas order their signature burger, and we split their mac and cheese... which was absolutely amazing! It's definitely not the best I had, but close enough.. and I highly recommend it.  I also order some wings which was okay, they were really tough to chew. Overall a good place.  Probably won't come back again since it's so very far.

Being from the southwest Valley and rarely in that part of town, I had never heard of it, but I'm always willing to try out new places.I arrived there at 5:30 on a weekday and there were only two people in there. That made me a little nervous, but the place looked nice on the inside and the bartender and hostess were very nice as well.I ordered a bacon cheeseburger with fries and everything was delicious! The burger was cooked exactly how I ordered. The meat tasted fresh and high-quality. The goodies that come with the burger (lettuce, onions, tomato, etc.) looked fresh and tasty. The fries were equally delicious. They're the thin and crispy type and not greasy at all.This little place pleasantly surprised me! If I'm ever in the neighborhood again, I will definitely go back to Charr. Nice staff, good service, reasonable prices, and great food. Can't really ask for more.

I ordered this amazing chicken sandwich that had zucchini, grilled onions, cheese an some other delicious veggies. It was literally the best sandwich I ever had. The only problem was that it had so many wonderful veggies on it that it kept falling out of the bread which I was fine with! I also had the sweet potato fries which were perfect and the bar tender made me the perfect Moscow mule. They have s ton of shakes as well and was gonna come back for one but I was just so full. My eyes were larger than my stomach. Totally am going back. Quaint atmosphere. Great food. Great service

We checked on Yelp and Charr came up. I wasn't so sure because some of the most recent reviews were not so favorable. We decided to take a chance and I am glad that we did. Our server, Kristen was great. She was very friendly and personable. Took our order with a smile and was very attentive to us.  We each ordered a burger, mine with fries and my wife's with onion rings. The food was very good and cooked the right way. Everything tasted very fresh. We look forward to coming back and trying more of the menu. Thanks again for the great service.......leave room for desert, I herd the shakes are great.

I've been there probably a half-dozen times over the past couple of months and have not had one negative experience (food OR service). If you don't like the prices, then all I can say is go to McDonalds next door.

The quality of the burgers and salads were outstanding. My son had the Carolina BBQ Burger, fries and a side salad, I had the The Phoenix Burger, onion rings with a wedge salad. The burgers were cooked perfect, their french fries and onion rings are the best I've had in years. It's so nice when the chipotle mayo, ketchup, lettuce (they use butter lettuce, yummy), tomato and onion is service on the side. That may sound crazy to some of you but I love it when the condiments are serviced on the side. Omgosh, we tried the Blueberry Bread Pudding, it was amazing. Our waitress Kristen S was attentive, courteous and best of all she knew the menu. We will definitely be stopping in again. Thank you for a delicious lunch.

The hamburgers are great and they have the best onion rings I've ever tasted. No complaints about the service.Nonetheless, our meal tonight was very uncomfortable. The owner paid for our meal and told us not to come back. The hamburgers now automatically come with truffle fries, which is a step in the right direction as they are a bit pricey. My niece wanted to know if she could substitute sweet potato fries and pay a little extra. The waitress indicated that this was not their policy. However, she would ask the owner indicatiing he would not like it. The owner came to our table asking what was wrong. So my niece asked again. The owner indicated we were getting the fries for free. My husband indicated that he does not eat fries so they would be wasted. My niece said matter of factly, ""So you don't make exceptions."" She did not say it in an accusatory mannter. This is when the owner's friendliness turned to hostility. He said that we would get everything we wanted on the house and added, ""Don't come back."" Maybe the owner had had enough complaints for the day. I don't think we were obnoxious. We were not asking for anything for free. We would have accepted, ""sorry no exceptions. We wouldn't have liked it, but it wouldn't have stopped us from coming back as the hamburgers are that good. The restaurant refused to take our money even though we expected to pay. (Ironically we were using a Groupon.)I don't have complaints about the food or service; in fact I have recommended Charr to others who liked it. I am not advising anyone not to patronize Charr. The food is great, but the owner overreacted. We live in Sunnyslope and like to support local businesses. However, the owner made it very clear that he did not want or need our business."

We were a little early for our reservation, so we sat at the bar. The bartender was really nice and lively. I ordered a cocktail off their menu and it was pretty good. When we sat down for our meal it took some time for our server to get to us. She came to us and asked if we had been helped since we already had drinks. I guess the hostess didn't inform her?  We ordered crab cakes for our appetizer, the portabella burger with truffle fries for me and steak with marsalla sauce with potato cake and asparagus for the boyfriend, and bread pudding with Bourbon blueberries for dinner. This is the reason I'm giving this place 3 stars: service was really slow! Another couple sat next to us after we were seated and they got their food before us. I'm not sure if it was because of the steak we ordered, but it was a long time until we got our main course. The actual food tasted good, but nothing to die for really. Also, their tap water tasted a bit off. Maybe it wasn't filtered? Eek..Just like this rating, my experience at Charr was A-Ok.

The service was a little slow but the food was wonderful. We had the charr garlic chili glazed wings, easily in the top 3 wings of all time meaty, crispy, and the sauce was amazing, we actually had the waiter leave the plate of sauce so we could dip our fires in it. We had the Carolina BBQ Burger on a garlic knot instead of regular bun, which is a genius idea, and the truffle fries. We finished our meals with the apple crumb cobbler. Everything was amazing. Even though it was a far drive for us, we will be making the trek again just for those wings and burgers. Can't wait to try out the rest of their menu.

I'm shocked at the service critiques. We've been here a lot, and only once did we have mediocre service. Otherwise it's been terrific. I love the Buffalo Chicken sandwich, but really everything here is  excellent. I like the onion soup or the wedge salad for a starter. The burgers are tasty and too much to eat even for a big guy. The beer and wine selections have what I like. The atmosphere is just right. Not only that, but they will bring up Italian from their deli if you ask. What's not to like about Charr?
463|1WBkAuQg81kokZIPMpn9Zg|L_aNyxy-hbLA4DbUxgWLrg|JpQIdPw1ecBcePJepkWWag|Phoenix|Charr An American Burger Bar|-112.063404|33.60731|85022|Well I finally got around to doing a writeup on charr. The reviews here seem mixed so I had to check it out for myself. The first thing I noticed was the setup -- the multi-color backlit bar and the nice flat-screen LED tvs. I'm a big football fan so I will be sure to come by to eat and never miss a game! I came for dinner and was seated very quickly by the hostess. Menu had a wide selection of appetizers, salads, soups and drinks. Went for the charrburger with some custom toppings to my liking, beer on tap, and crab cakes to start. Some other reviews mentioned about price but having sampled other places in phoenix like Delux  I found the prices to be quite on par. More on what I think of the value later.I got my crab cakes to start and they were excellent! Very moist, tasty and hit the spot. Next was my burger and it was quite a burger. The garlic knot bun turns out to be the differentiator between the other joints I ate at so I give charr the nod on the taste of the burgers. I thought the food was excellent and certainly of the best I have had.Whether it is charr or the other burger places I sampled that serve high quality gourmet burgers, I think the price is very reasonable. This is not processed meat and the quality of the food, the ambiance where I can kick back and watch the games on the flat screen tvs and hang with my buddies makes it well worth the price. I dont plan on coming every night but at the end of a hard week of work it's nice to have a place to hang with both my buddies and colleagues for some drinks and/or food. If I want a cheap burger I can always get a big mac at the other end of the mall but I always regret it later when I choose fast food over quality.Overall, I enjoyed my meal and the atmosphere and the service. I liked the other burger joints I have been trying as well but give the nudge to charr. I'd say try it out for yourself. Tip: waited at the bar for buddies to arrive afterwards for drinks and surprisingly found some cool outlets right under the bartop I could charge my pda while waiting. Very hard to find outlets to charge my phone while I am out so this was a nice bonus! They are kind of hidden under the counter so not sure this is well known!

By FAR the best deal is the Hot Dog (Phoenix or Carolina style) for $6 which comes on the same huge pretzel bun as the burger and comes with excellent truffle fries.The wedge ($6) is very small.

I had the Salmon with lemon sauce and capers, my partner had the Grilled Garlic Chicken - both were cooked perfectly, the potato cake was even in a separate container so the sauces did not soak up into them.  The portions were more than generous, even for the salmon.  I had dinner and lunch from the one dish.  I will definitely be ordering from them again.

This time I ordered a burger and she got steak sandwich, we both ordered medium rare...I thought that means pink in the middle...well, they both came out well done. Granted they tasted fine, but when you prefer your meat cooked a certain way, you'd hope it is. If you order, order well below how you like your meat, it will likely come out more done then expected. I guess next time I will ask they don't even kill the cow, just embarrass it =-p

I drove by Isa's pizza which was, unfortunately, closed. I decided to stop in to Charr as they were still open and close by.  I sat at the bar and the bartenders we very friendly. I ordered the fried zucchini and a blue moon. They are very generous with the zucchini even though it is only an appetizer and the beer was cold and refreshing. The zucchini came with a side of ranch, but I prefer marinara, which they did not have, but they were able to accommodate me with their pomodoro soup which is very similar. I will definitely be going back and bringing friends. :)

We had the flank steak in Marsala sauce.  My dining partner nearly licked the plate it was so delicious.  The potato croquet that accompanied it was also totally yummy--crispy on the outside and fluffy and cheesy on the inside.  Service has been great every time we've been there, prompt and attentive but not intrusive.  The burgers are always lovely, juicy and done as requested --a perfect pink medium rare--and the fries are addictive.  Monday night is bargain burger night and a complete steal.  Love this place!  A great addition to the Moon Valley neighborhood. The owner has been in the house every time we've been here and he always checks in to make sure we're enjoying our meal.  When they first opened, the fries were not included with the burger entrees, but they have since remedied that, which was a really good decision.

I had passed this shopping center on Thunderbird numerous times and wondered what the *&&^% was in there.  Now I know.The restaurant cuisine is modern American.  What I mean to say is that the food is basic American fare with a twist.  The restaurant has delicious hamburgers...........hence the name  - Charr.  The presentation is also modern as is the restaurant.  I rather enjoyed the Caesar's salad with REAL anchovies and a hamburger with REAL Swiss cheese and crimini mushrooms - yum!  My little one had the mac and cheese that was creamy and done perfectly.  My wife had the turkey burger which was juicy, not dry.Our server was delightful and had a great sense of humor and was real likeable in general.  I would opt to say that the food is on a five star level.  However, the time to fill the order and receive the food must have been close to one half hour.  I was especially cognizant of the time since I have a seven year old that was hungry and making every minute after ordering count.My advise to Charr, perfect the order time and you have a winner.The restaurant offers many daily specials, including hamburgers.  Try it out!

Ordered my burger mid rare, but it came raw.   They did the right thing and comped the burger....we will give them another try, because had the burger been cooked right, I'm sure it would have been great and they were nice people, doing the right thing.

I loved Aiello's when it was open and I like the Salumeria they have next door. Charr  was decent but not overwhelmingly good.The atmosphere is nice... I like the decor. Most of the servers are attractive young males.I had a Moscow Mule which was refreshing and potent. I thought the drinks, including the beer were overpriced.My husband ordered the Charr burger, cooked medium rare. He said it came medium well. He still thought the beef tasted good though. I ordered the roasted veggie sandwich. It was okay. The aioli that came on it was delicious. The bun that both my sandwich and my husband's burger came on was good and I liked the idea but it came apart on both of us.The fries were thin and crispy and yummy but our server only brought out one serving for us to share. I noticed other tables of two each had their own serving... hmmmm. Luckily we were more than full despite sharing one serving of fries.Service was good except for when my husband had to flag someone down for some mayo after getting our food. It took a solid 5 minutes. Our total bill before the Groupon discount for 2 burgers, fries, and 2 alcoholic beverages was around $45. A little overpriced for a burger date night.We will return for happy hour. The drinks were tasty and I am eager to try some of their appetizers.

They serve them in these little wire baskets that look like miniature fryers.  The burgers are good, of course, but salads are pretty good too.  Last visit I had the grilled chicken and was very impressed.  The beer selection is pretty good.  Their wine list is also good.

The house made o-rings were over battered and too greasy for my taste.  With two of the drinks being on ""Happy Hour"" (note: only seated at the bar or outside) seems pretty expensive for a burger joint.Had 3 servers standing around but only the bartender did anything - had to flag her down a time or two.  Still seems like they are sorting out things, hopefully pricing is one of them."

The item we liked the least was the burger, but that's not saying it wasn't good.  The soup and onion rings were awesome.  The truffle fries took center stage!Since our first visit we've been back several times and have had equally good experiences.  The service is always friendly and speedy, but sometimes the kitchen is a little slow.  I don't mind the speed because good food is worth the wait, which it is here.It's a great addition to the Moon Valley neighborhood!

Let's just run down the good things about Charr real quick: About the restaurant itself: -takes reservations on Open Table.  Sweet. -had reservations available on time on our arrival.   something to be said as many places don't! -nice outdoor patio -good ambiance and decorationsAbout the food:  -crab cake appetizer was good. flaky, good flavors, good size for sharing (2 on the plate) -my cousin loved the truffle fries  (she actually took the leftover fries to go she liked them so much)-I had the salmon burger.   The salmon was perfectly cooked.  I decided to forego the bun, it was delicious on its own.  I get that this is a ""burger joint"" so there's a theme, but it's great as a non-burger too (that's how i would order in the future) -My cousin had the BBQ burger.   MMM!!!  I had a few bites of it.  Now that's a burger!  Get it!-The garlic knot buns are awesome!  -The Moscow Mule was perfect!  Served in a copper mug, minty fresh, all I hoped for! My only grumble about this place was that the service was pretty slow.  We sat outside and it seemed like our waitress didn't know if we were in her section or not, though she was friendly.  It took about 10 minutes for anyone to greet us after we had been seated  The meal took about 2 hours to finish for the two of us.  Nevertheless, it was enjoyable!!  If you're up for a leisurely meal, definitely hit up Charr's."

It was busy, good Saturday night vibe. Owner (Joe) was circulating and jovial. Though they are on the pricey side on their regular menu, the restaurant week deal was generous. A large and very strong cocktail, the Charrismo (their take on a cosmopolitan). Quite good. Appetizers, I had crab cakes, GF had wings after asking to make sure they weren't too spicy. They were about a 5 on a scale of 10 spiciness, too much for her. Waitress offered to exchange 'em, but we simply swapped. I thought they were great. Fries with orders, I had salmon burger (great), GF had Portobello Burger (phenomenal). I had a beer flight, she had a glass of Chardonnay. Then we still had desserts, but were full so we'll get to those tonight. Really a great deal for 30 bucks per. I'll be back, probably for Happy Hour because they are a bit pricey on the regular menu.....

Will agree with some of the previous reviewers to say service was slow but not anything painful.  It was just a laid back type slow, but I could see how it would get on people's nerves.  Overall both me and my moms hamburgers were good quality cooked correctly and had interesting topics.  Their fries are great!! This is trying to have a more gourmet type feel for the area and maybe people are not prepared for it.  I liked it and the atmosphere is funky.  Would definately take friends and family back.

I expected the bun to be more like the garlic knots but it had no special taste, just a different shape.  The service was a little slow, most noticeable when a table of 5 people that arrived 5-7 minutes after us were served 5 minutes before we were.

I would pass on this next time- Phoenix burger: a hint of heat, but otherwise meh. The bun is not a normal bun, but rather some sort of knotted bun that fell apart when I bit into it. It was definitely hard to eat. The meat was well-cooked though (hit right on med-rare). Truffle fries were thin and right on. They had perfect crunch- flat iron steak: coworker enjoyed it, as well as the green bean and potato cake side- lemontini: really tasty The bartenders were great. Jill and Mimi were fantastic company. This is a solid place for good conversation and decent food, but definitely not the best burger I've had. I will say it is a place with great value. During their reverse happy hour ($3 well drinks, $3 off appetizers, $5 burgers), our total came out to $60 before tip. That was for 2 oyster shooters, 3 drinks, zucchini fries, phoenix burger, 2 raw oysters, and the flat iron steak. Not bad!

Probably one and done here for me as I will gladly enjoy a culvers or paradise valley burger company and go to Scottsdale when I want to pay $13 for a cocktail.  Sorry guys, not worth it.

I purposefully waited to write this since we wanted to re-try a couple of other places nearby for comparison.  We had 2 wedge salads, 2 burgers, an order of onion rings and 3 beers.  $60.  In the next two weeks we went to a nearby sports bar/Italian place and a brewpub.  For similar quantities, the price was $35 at one place and $38 at the other, both similar quality.  I have a hard time justifying the higher price tag, especially considering how loud it was at Charr, it was difficult to have a conversation.  The beer selection is good, but overpriced as was the case with everything.  Doing a la carte will be a tough sell when that is not what everyone else does.  We may return but not often unless the value gets better.  I wish them well but would encourage them to consider some changes that will price them more competitively.

Place should be great with nice surroundings, quality ingredients, and diverse menu. Restaurant failed at the two key places. A brand new server who was slow and inefficient was irritating, but the real sin was over cooking the burgers. 4 people at the table ordered medium and 1 was served medium and 3 well done.  I assume the beef was as high quality as everything else, but I had no way to tell with meat that over cooked.

Cheated on my standard, Ammacapanne's, 3 times to try this place.  Much better fare, but much worse service.  This most recent visit, the hostess seated us and I asked for a reminder on what the WiFi password was (I'm not a total douche...my wife and I run a small biz together and commonly work over meals and drinks).  The hostess kinda curtly said she didn't know if the place even has WiFi (I knew it did) and didn't know the password if it did.   No effort to go get it.  Finally waited for a server, who vaguely thought she knew it.  I'm not in the HRM industry, except as a consumer, but I can't imagine not training my staff on this.  Love the ambiance and food. Just disappointing service in my 3 visits.The servers at Ammacapanne's still win the day in this area for me.

Felt at home with Joe greeting all of the customers, just like at Aiello's in Central Phoenix. Burgers are good. Onion rings are lightly battered and tasty. Good selection of craft beers. Nice array of selections other than burgers too. This place will be one of our regular eateries. Congrats to Joe and Myrah for another great concept.

They did not disappoint. I got a steakhouse burger with A1 and crispy onion rings which was the best burger I've had in Phoenix. The fries with truffle oil that came with it were on point.  My fiance got a flat iron salad with a spicy ranch dressing, it was amazing but she kept trying to steal bites of my burger so looks like I'm going to have to come back by myself.

French Onion soup was superb, as was the crab cake appetizer, and our dinners (Pork Tenderloin and Hangar Steak with Marsala wine sauce and mushrooms). Pork was juicy and sauce was just right with the apples lightly cooked but still with a bit of a crunch, and the steak was cooked just as ordered - medium rare.

We ordered the Family Dinner to go from Aiello's Salumeria just down the sidewalk, and ate here while waiting for our food. Bryan had the green chili burger while I had the pizza burger. We decided to order different ones so we could split and try both. The buns are actually garlic knots or something similar, but they are shaped like cinnabons in which the dough is spiraled all the way to the center. Unique fun idea but man, does this make for a horribly messy burger. You are forced to gobble up the burgers very quickly so they don't fall apart on you. The pizza burger was good, but I liked the chili one more just because there was more flavor to it. It's not that spicy either, so if you're afraid of spice, you are safe to order this chili one. The restaurant and bar are very nice. I loved the dark woods and back lighting. The place is alot more trendy and fun in comparison to the rustic, yet charming older restaurant on Central Avenue close to Camelback. I'm hoping for this place to be a success, but I feel like there are a few more ""things"" that need to be worked out. Even if their burgers are just okay to most people it seems (after reading several previous reviews), let me assure you that their regular Italian food is their specialty and what they're amazing at!"

And I mean wow in the best possible way! Party of 7 came by on a Friday night with no expectations, no reservations, and a 2 year old which can usually spell out a recipe for disaster but boy did Charr impress! We were seated right away at a perfect size table and greeted immediately by our very friendly and very competent server. We received info on the specials as well as tips for first timers. Our drinks came right away and our server was even conscientious enough to ask if we should bring the 2 year old's food right away! (YES PLEASE!). Mr. Aiello himself came by to greet us twice and make sure that everything was perfect. So, what did we have? I can tell you, I had one of the best salmon burgers I've ever had in my whole life. A delicious, perfectly cooked filet atop the most delicious house made garlic knot bun. What I loved most was the fact that the bun never got soggy from the lemon basil mayo sauce and the arugula was so fresh I'd swear that it was snipped that day!  The salmon was perfectly done. The baby had housemade macaroni and cheese that every adult at the table swore was the best ever. I think we might all have it next time as a main dish ourselves. 4 different cheeses mixed in the sauce and topped with a slice of cheddar and baked to perfection. O.M.G. Several of the grown-ups had the Phoenix Burger and the Charr Burger. Everyone said the burgers were DE-LIC-IOUS and cooked to perfection since so many of us have different degrees of doneness that we prefer.  Final friend had the pork tenderloin and while that fell a tad short versus the burgers, the overall dining experience left her feeling 5 star all the way. Dessert was also superb. I had the Strawberries and Zabaglione sauce while others had the Apple Cobbler served hot with vanilla ice cream. All were super yum. While this restaurant is very out of the way for us, we will definitely be making an effort to go out of our way again to visit Charr very very soon.  Thank you for a great experience and excellent food!

The reviews here didnt seem all that great but we live close by and found a groupon for their wings and 4 drinks (beer, wine or mixed) for only $18! Wings = outstanding! The spicyness of the wings does build up and make it almost unbearably hot (to me) but the chili sauce they put on them is delish! Alcohol = we had a few of their drafts which were pretty good: Purple Hazed (something like that), Mission Lager, Sweaty Betty, and Four Peaks Kiltlifter, yummy!!Staff: friendly and attentive; family owned i think? even the owner/ chef came up to us a couple times while we were at the bar to make sure the bartender was treating us well (his son apparantly) Atmosphere: upscale, romantic, really nice!! Prices: expensive if you don't come here for happy hour! We gave in and tried ""The Phoenix"" burger and it was amazing!!  It is expensive considering they don't include a side with your burger but the food is awesome and worth a try!"

I enjoyed my visit, but wouldn't say it was spectacular.  If I am in the area, I will stop in again.

When we arrived on a Sunday about 6:30pm, the place was almost completely empty. This scared me a little, but there was a local NFL game starting at that time (Cardinals vs Seahawks) and, it seems, everyone was at the game. I'm told the place normally has a wait to get in.Inside, they have 4 large flat screen TVs (3 over the bar, 1 at the opposite corner) showing sports with closed captioning on (thank you!).My wife and I each ordered burgers and she had a side of the Mac and Cheese.My burger came with fries.The hamburger buns are very unique. They are like a swirled garlic bread. However, there was really no noticeable garlic taste, which is a good thing as far as I'm concerned. But each time I brought the burger up to my mouth, the aroma of garlic from the bread was quite nice.The Mac and Cheese has elbow macaroni sitting a soup of a cheese blend that is more like how 'grandma used to make' then you might expect. It was, like the burgers, exceptional.The fries are shoestring style (very thin, very crunchy) and everything tastes fresh (not frozen) and home made. The burgers are not uniform in shape or thickness, which tells me they are made by hand. Hallelujah!The service was outstanding. The staff was extremely attentive. I noticed they have a 'Vernors Pound Cake' on the desert menu. Vernor's is a drink made in Detroit (where I was born and raised). I asked if the restaurant was Detroit-inspired and was told it's actually Brooklyn, New York-inspired and they really like Vernor's Ginger Ale in New York. They also have a root beer float on the menu, so I asked the staff if they offer a Vernor's float instead. (A Vernor's float is known by folks in Detroit as a 'Boston Cooler' and its no different than a root beer float, except you substitute Vernor's for root beer.)They never heard of it before (not shocking, since no one outside of Detroit has ever heard of it) but they were more than happy to make one for me. And it was delicious!My wife thought the ice tea she ordered tasted a little off, but she didn't say anything to the staff. I have no doubt they would have made it right if she brought it to their attention. She also ordered the Vernor's Pound Cake for desert. She thought it was too rich for her liking, but it wasn't bad by any means.It appears the three restaurants beside each other are all owned and run by the same entity. There is Charr, then a pizza place (Isa's Pizza) and then a fine dining restaurant called Aiello's East Coast Italian.There were plenty of items on the menu I wanted to try, such as baby back ribs and a grilled chicken sandwich. The pizza served next door looked good and Aiello's also looks like a nice place for us to try as well.So we have four reasons to go back (try each of the other two restaurants, try other menu items at Charr, and if worse comes to worst, we would definitely go back to Charr and have REAL, fresh handmade burgers again! If I was going to open my own burger joint, this is similar to how I would do it.  There's only so many fast-food burgers one can ingest before desperately craving something that isn't factory made and doesn't require a loan to pay off. (our complete total for dinner and desert was $39 after tax. Quite reasonable and fair considering the quality and quantity of the food and the excellent service we received.)

I'm convinced these places justify their high burger prices by adding the descriptor ""gourmet"" to their name, and offering a variety of burger options. Who would have imagined that $10+ for a cheeseburger would be a good deal??We ordered the American Turkey burger, Charr Burger with cheese, and the kid's meal chicken fingers. We thought the turkey burger was a bit on the dry side. It comes with a garlic aioli, which was flavorful, but there was a lot of it! The cheeseburger was ordered medium, and was more medium-well. It was good, though. The little one loved the chicken fingers and all of us devoured the truffle fries!Attentive service, nice ambience. Decent food."

Went for dinner and had the traditional burger and it was awesome! The burger was cooked to perfection with a flavorful charr crust and placed on a homemade garlic knot bun.  The truffle fries were sensational!  My  sister had the grilled chicken sandwich with grilled vegetables which was also delicious.  The veggies were grilled perfectly and seasoned to perfection. The bread was warm and had a nice crunchy crust.   Love the open kitchen and the atmosphere in the restaurant; very warm and welcoming.   Service was excellent!   Will definitely return to try other entrees.

Joe personally cooked for us. We were seated in a little area good for 25 people. Service began with white and red wine. I ordered more than one light and refreshing sangria's this evening. Sara makes this sacred sangria with her secret ingredient Grand Marnier. This very berry refreshing drink is a great way to enjoy summer dinners.Course one is mixed baby greens and cold antipasto platters of prosciutto, souprisatta, spek, housemade mozzarella, provolone ,grilled vegetables, roasted peppers, marinated artichokes with a country mix of earthy, delectable olives.Course two for me was  Linguine Fra Diavolo with shrimp, clams, mussels, calamari hot pepper bite. Fra Divalo translates as ""Brother Devil"", hinting that this dish is a little spicy but it was mild enough.Out of respect I wanted to thank Joe for the fabulous meal and the wonderful staff because as Don Corleone once said ""Friendship is everything. Friendship is more than talent. It is more than the government. It is almost the equal of family"". -Mario Puzo."

On the test night, you'd expect mistakes and working out the kinks. In our case, every aspect was just spot on. My eldest, the self styled expert on wings, pronounced Charr's Chili Glazed Wings the best she's ever had. My youngest, not a wing fan, devoured them. High praise from both ends of the spectrum.Last night, spot on again. Burgers on large garlic knots are excellent, juicy and perfectly cooked. Wings...yep, perfect again. A couple of Leini'e Summer Shandy bottles, super cold and served in cold glasses by our excellent and friendly server Kevin (only his third day, and you'd never know. Great job Kevin!) Fries were nice and crispy (called Truffle Fries, and while did not taste the truffle oil, they were still very good). Really well done concept, great service and excellent food!

We started with the chili glazed wings. Now I'm not much of a wing person but these were awesome - super crisp and the glaze was amazing. For our entrees I picked the mushroom & brie burger and my boyfriend got the phoenix burger which both came with truffle fries. The server failed to ask how we wanted our burgers done and without being asked I forgot to specify so I ended up with a well done burger which I'm not into. The flavors were there just the fact that it was overcooked ruined it for me. My boyfriend enjoyed his though. The fries were phenomenal! I love truffle fries and these were some of the best I've had, really thin and the perfect level of crisp. For dessert we got a slice of cheesecake - nothing special, but it was good. Decent experience overall.

If the service was up to par I'd go back sooner.

Menu on a chalk board was quaint, but hard to follow. I felt pressure to decide when the waiter visited my table to explain the menu. Since I was dining alone, the drink selection was limited. (Maybe if I ordered a bottle of something, but I only wanted a glass.) I began the meal with a complimentary Bruchetta on Crusted Bread. The tomato and olive oil was so fresh. I then ordered the Arugula Salad with Shaved Parmesan and a Balsamic Vinegar Reduction. Yum! Ate every bit. Then I ordered the Farfalle Pasta with Lamb Ragu. The portion was huge. Couldn't finish. It tasted very nice -- not out of this world, but still quite good. Only down side, the price. Meal for one with salad, drink and tip was over $50. For that price, I expected more. Probably won't return.

Italian to the core, the staff is Italian and the restaurant is said to be family owned. We took the Rigatoni and the risotto. Both plates were absolutely delicious.

It might look pricy at first, but the food here is worth every penny. If you're in Montreal be sure to stop by Lucca for a meal.

Really delicious Huevos Rancheros available all day.

I think this is a great safety precaution for any 24 hour business and its nice to know the owner cares about their staff.I do not like that they are always out of stuff when I come after 9PM. It is always stuff I'm really craving too! Like pickles, or avocados, or tuna. I definitely think for a location that has to be open 24 hours they should stock better and help set their employees up for a successful night.Over all not the worst Subway I have ever been too. Employees are always tired by the time I get there, but they are friendly!

The wait at Brio on Mother's Day was 90 minutes, so GameWorks provided a much-needed distraction for Baby C.  Hat tip to Phil T for mentioning this place.  Otherwise, I would have never known about it.I noticed a few games were straight-up imports from Japan, and other games that I had never seen anywhere else, such as Kung-Fu Panda (so much fun), Transformers and Mario Kart.  There's the usual skee-ball, and some air hockey games as well.  I paid an absurd amount of $ for Baby C to get candy and some water gun made in Taiwan, but that's not the point.  The point is 90 minutes went by pretty quickly, and Baby C was totally entertained.  Not entirely happy about paying a deposit for a card, since I gave it back to GameWorks at the end of the day.  But it's Vegas, so you're not even thinking about it.

My friends ordered nachos but they didn't look like they liked them much. Bartender as others are saying did seem slower. In terms of an arcade venue, the space is massive and seems like they devoted too much room for restaurant as opposed to adding more games; possibly a bigger bowling alley with more lanes. I did not get to check out the LAN they had setup; next time!

The staff were extremely helpful and so easy to work with in planning and when we arrived. The place was festive and most importantly the food and drink was good and plentiful.Our average age is 40 and everyone had a blast. Some people were playing games for the first time and the staff made sure they learned how to use the controls in a fun and patient way.We had a last minute conflict so our numbers were suddenly fewer than expected but they worked with us and we were very happy with how the party turned out.We will return!

It's not bad, enough space for the families to sit around and hang out. The downfall, there was no one working at the bar within the bowling area. Made it difficult for everyone to look after their belongings and children while ordering food and drinks. lol. Enjoy the ugly neon shoes.  I did however like the pretzels with spicy cheese dip. Highlight: the photobooth.  Spend forever personalizing your photos.  Fun!

First game we play and it takes our 9 credits and doesn't work. Well that was great. Credits do cost money it's not like we were on some play for so many hours thing. Things were pretty cool from there until we got to the giant fish reel. The reel says we won 70 tickets awesome, the box even says we were awarded 70. So of course since 70 is a lot lets play again. This time the giant reel says we won 60 tickets! Child is super excited and I look down at the box and it says 15 tickets awarded. WHAT?! So I got robbed of 9 credits and at least 45 tickets. Never thought to watch any of the other times we won tickets so who knows how many Game Works really stole from us. It was over all a good time, just left a bad feeling knowing we got ripped off.

Used my gift card that I purchased from a fundraiser for 2 hrs of swipe and play. The only thing that irritated me was that every time i swiped..

I will be back to use the other Card i have with my girls!! **Suggestion** Please include cell phone charging station. --thank you :)

We came by for a late lunch on a weekday and it was almost empty and devoid of small children. We sat at the bar and ordered an Irish Mai Tai (has beer in it) and a blackberry Moscow Mule. They weren't exactly stellar cocktails, but they were tasty enough. On the menu are several items where, if you order them, you can opt to pay more and get a 1-hour game card. This seemed like a great deal. We opted for the nachos, which were priced at $12. By paying $14.99, instead of $12, we got a game card for all the games letting us play whatever we wanted for 1-hr. The one catch is that you can't earn tickets when playing with a timeframe card. But you definitely get a lot more play for you money. The nachos were pretty good. Standard bar fare. The selection of games was pretty good, including some unique ones we'd never seen before. In addition to skee ball and some of the other usual suspects, there was also a motion roller coaster ride and a 4D scary shooting game one. In sum, we had a great time and will be back for more fun.

The things that bugged me is that it is very pricey and the tickets compared to the prizes is very expensive! Something I can purchase at the store for maybe $10 cost 1000 tickets or maybe $50 of hard work gaining the tickets. So with that being said if you are in it for the fun and ready to spend lots of money then have at it! The service though was great!

I definitely enjoy playing Skee Ball, air hockey, and other arcade games while having an adult beverage. It's like Chuck E. Cheese for adults, except there are also kids too. Because there are kids, you probably shouldn't try to get tanked here, but they don't create a distraction or prevent adults from having a good time. There's a solid variety of games for all tastes.The food is equal to above average bar food, which is fine by my standards. The real reason for ordering food is so I can get the Dine & Play combo, the best deal by far. The combo lets you get certain entrees plus a one hour ($15.99) or two hour ($21.99) game card. I'd pay those prices merely for the card, so throwing in an entree on top makes the combo a great deal. It's much cheaper than paying the cash rate. The game card doesn't let you earn tickets, but you can still play most of the ticket games without earning. I don't care about winning a stuffed bear, so that's not a problem.Drink a beer. Kill some zombies. Race a motorcycle.

Did the 2 hour special on card with one entree (pizza) for $23 bucks. Not bad, considering I let the kids share the card instead of buying them there own card with limited amount of credits; which in my opinion is more expensive. Food wasnt amazing but wasnt terrible either. Had a lot of cool stuff like a separate bowling alley and a separate video game console area to play pc/video games - that however isnt part of the gaming card deal and you have to pay $5 per person per hour FYI. Someone gave us their all day pass because they were leaving so the kids got to play longer. We did leave and did the pay it forward thing to and gave the card to someone else to utitlize as well. Would love to see more old school arcade games as well as more games in general. Typical arcade games that could be found at Dave n Busters, Chuck E Cheese, etc.

I don't care much for kids so I know not to come during the weekend. I love playing video games and love to drink, I'm in heaven because this place has both. I can't say anything about the food because I've never had it. I can say that the service is either hit or miss, most of the bartenders are really really nice I've had 1 bartender a really pretty asian girl with a bad attitude but other than that I can't complain. I typically have a beer on draft and they are always very cold and the prices aren't bad. I always go for the Groupon special $20 for the all day pass because I could spend Hours playing games. Keep in mind that Game Works is not a big place so Yes you will have to wait for a game or two. This is a great place to come during the week and kill some time while having a few cold ones.

Not enough actual arcade games. And some are already broken or not working yet. Bar and restaurant area is too big, takes up half of the place. Bowling is $5 per game and $4 for shoes. Needs a lot of work to get out all the kinks to make this a great local spot.

There was a bar, which is a plus. But for a Saturday night.. The bar was completely understaffed. This is probably the longest I had to wait for a drink. Which made me a little irritated. Pricing was not bad compared to other places on the strip. Decor is very nice... But they need to staff accordingly!!!!! Not as many games as the previous GAMEWORKS in Vegas. The bathrooms were a little dirty as well. I would come back to see if this would change.

They have all types of arcade games for reasonable prices. Upon entering, you load a Gameworks card which will cost you a one time $2 fee. Then, you can add points into the card. The deal I purchased was 120 points for $22. On Tuesdays they have double ticket earnings which is a great deal! I enjoyed playing everything from ski ball to Mario kart to pinball and basketball. They offer so many classic arcade games for few points. Ski ball was only 2 points per turn so you can imagine how far your $22 go. Plus, you received so many tickets for playing that the prizes to choose from at the end were not just limited to candy.

The games could use some updating, but the air hockey table was where they spent most of there time! This was not your average air hockey table. This was air hockey on steroids. At different times like 20 small pucks would slide down on the table and it was a blast seeing the kids faces light up with excitement! We got here a bit late so we didn't get to try the food, but looking at the pics on Yelp, I may just go back for lunch before we leave Vegas. The bar looked pretty cool as well had 2 pool tables in back, but I was with my kids and holding my littlest man man so no adult activities for daddy. Another cool thing about this place is they had a section with some of the classics, Pac Man, Donkey Kong, just to name a few. All and all the kids had a blast even little guy fun on some riding games.Ambiance 3/5Food 0/5 but looking forward to trying Drink 0/5 Service 0/5Overall Experience 3/5Till next time Drink, Eat, and Enjoy this life you live - Groux

There are tons of games, bowling, food and drinks (for the adults ). We have been here a few times and each time of course the kids left very happy (and tired, thankfully). They have games for tickets which can be traded in for prizes in the end as well as a room full of computer/video games. Games for everyone! They have a few pretty good deals for games only but the one we took advantage of was the unlimited play for an hour with an entree. There was some miscommunication between how to purchase the deal and we got sent around to 3 different people so that was a bit frustrating. Only other downfall was the service in the restaurant. We waited for almost 10 minutes before anyone came and greeted us or got our drinks, then another 30 minutes for our food. I'm not a master chef but I don't think our nachos, cheese pizza and burger takes that long to prepare. Also, our server was less than attentive. Nonetheless, I know people don't go there for the food its just an added incentive while you are there to play games!!!! Cool spot again to drink and play games, maybe dine at another nearby establishment though.

Sometimes the card allows you to play, but won't give you tickets. They had almost every type of game to play such as video old school arcade games,pin ball, virtual racing, air hockey, bowling, live xbox, pool table, basket ball shooting, etc...they also have a restaurant and bar. It has plenty seating. This place is good for meeting friends and having drinks. It's crowded during the weekends,but best time to go if you're an adult is Sun-Thurs after kids curfew 10pm. This allows you to play almost all the games, when it's crowded it becomes stuffy and hot, so dress lightly. Food and drinks are inexpensive, no coins are needed, you just buy a preloaded card and play as much as what you purchased. I hadn't had that much fun in years, that it left my hand and arm sore lol! Hats off to them for bringing kids, adults, and families out, and having a fun place to interact.

I bought the Groupon that came with the all-day game card and the $10 game card for the ticket games. My husband and I took our four kids.I have to say that the all-day game card isn't really worth it. By two or three hours, you'll probably have had your fill of gaming. The arcade is not really that big. If you're there on a weekend, like we were, you'll have to deal with rude Vegas people cutting in front of you while you're waiting in line for a game. That was not fun. I feel like they could have cut back on the dining area, which seemed empty most of the time, to add more room for arcade games.We ate dinner there and I thought it was reasonably priced for Vegas (except for the $9 mozzarella sticks). The food was good. The location adds a lot of value to this place. When my younger kids got bored with games, we were able to go play at the Town Square park. When the whole family was bored, we went and saw a movie at the AMC theater. We had planned to spend the whole day just doing GameWorks, but quickly discovered that it wasn't entertaining enough for an entire day, so I'm glad that we had all the other Town Square options to choose from.

The former Gamewirks that was on the Strip was a wonderful attraction. It had hundreds of games in a large space as well as a rock climbing wall that was transformed into an area for more games. When the original closed in Spring 2012, it was pretty heartbreaking. There were no real arcade places around Las Vegas that was on the level of Gameworks. This new TownSquare Gameworks is a degrader. It's far more smaller which was a huge disappointment. There were a few games that were attractive such as the 3-D zombie game, basketball, football, a fighter jet simulator, a computer gaming area, and the bowling alley. Everything else was more for the younger children running around. There is also a bar for the adults to relax which is nice for them. There is a new ""Recharge Center"" to reload credit into your card which is needed for the games, which is great. Other than that I wish this place was larger and beeds more games."

I promise you'd love this location well I did and would suggest it to anyone who wants to have a party here, or even just to hang out! I highly recommend it.

And, so do we.  There are no tickets or tokens like CEC, just a nifty little Gamecard that you add money to and tracks your points.  Plus, the toys/gifts are 1000 times better than CEC.  I love they have a bar and am always sure to treat myself.  Plus I love that they are in TownSquare so you can make an entire day and have lunch, shop, play, even see a movie.  My only complaint is that we do end losing money in broken games.  It is a little chaotic because they are so busy, but we have always had a good experience regardless because staff is super friendly.

The food is good and there is a good happy hour during the week. I would like to give a shoutout to Michael for helping me with a problem with my card and recommending some food for my dinner. He helped during a stressful misplacement of my game card which had all my tickets.

We started with delicious,well made Sweet Thai Chicken Sandwiches and the crispy, chicken Tenders as well. The meal took a little while to be served but the service was great. While waiting we realized that the television was uncomfortable to watch at times because the contrast was WAY too high.After our meal we bought game cards. First, we had to buy a new card that was $2 and then the actual credits range from ($5-$50) and then if you want to supersize the amount of credits you get, that's an extra $2 dollars as well. The prices of the credits weren't too bad but to actually enjoy yourself, you have to spend at least $20 due to how much credits each game takes. Overall GameWorks is SUPER fun and I'll definitely be back.

He was excited, we loaded $20 on his card and he blew through that in less than 45 minutes! The bowling alley looked nice we didn't bowl this time, however we did check it out for a potential birthday party site. Overall we enjoyed it, would love it if it were more reasonably priced.

Hosted my son's 6th bday in the cosmic bowling area for 25 - kids & adults. The kids bowled first, since we had to get them shoe'd up, bumpers & smaller-sized bowling balls; we ordered drinks & started snacking, leaving time for the kids to eat after they bowled w/ the adults settled in. The timeline worked out perfect for us. For food, we went with: - Fresh Fruit Tray -very fresh pineapples, melon, grapes, strawberries & blackberries; this is a huge colorful tray & loved it-Caesar Salad - Crisp with dressing on the side- loved the dressing, was surprisingly tasty as I didn't know what to expect-Baked Ziti -  this was also really surprisingly pleasing & a crowd favorite-Pizzas - I didn't try personally, but the first order was gobbled up so we ordered a second round that was also destroyedOverall, our hosts were super accommodating, worked with us within our budget & even helped us extend our party so that we could open gifts with family after everyone bowled/played in the arcade. A+ service!We added on the 2 hour game cards. If you rent the bowling area, I'd skip the games. First of all, it's a madhouse & hard to keep track of the little ones. We could have just bowled w/ everyone (disclaimer: because we had so many adults, it was fun for the kids to clear out for awhile so adults had some space to bowl). The timed game cards are confusing- they don't work on many games & no tickets. The solution would be to get the paid game cards that play for tickets. I heard the cocktails were light but wines & beers appeased - I would stick with the mid-level bar tickets over the premium & next time - also comes w/ a variety of soft drinks in the package, refills included.As far as kids parties go in an arcade setting, I highly recommend. I loved how easy going, yet attentive the planners and staff were. A solid 4.5 kid's party.

The arcade was Very clean this time.   Most  of the machines were in working order. Staff was very friendly and responsive when we used  a game that was broken. We went on a dark 3D game which is an additional fee it  was very cool and felt like we got our money's worth.   I saw a big improvement over the last time I was there.   I hope they improved their food and next time I'm there I'll try their kitchen again.

I came for Sunday football and met up with some friends, some of whom have children.Each game was prominently displayed. There are not only big flat screens but projector tv's as well. Plus, audio for one game was playing. The food was typical bar food with wings, fish and chips, salads, calamari, works fries, and overloaded nachos. The portions are also fairly generous. Though there are seemingly more up scale dinners as well like steak or salmon. While I didn't try the attempts at finer food, I question the logic and quality of the ingredients of an arcade which may see someone order salmon once a week.There's enough to keep the kids entertained so long as it's not busy. The size of the building is comparable to other chains like Dave and Buster's thanks to the bowling alley and private rooms. The designers made an oversized dining and tv watching area that doesn't fit with the number of game machines. If the dining room were packed with parents, the lines for games would be three kids deep. That is to say, there aren't enough game machines if business picks up.As far as the bar, they do have about ten things on tap including Angry Orchard, Stella, and Sam Adams. I did find it annoying that every time is came back to the bar and the same bartender, she had to check my id. I'm a huge hipster in a hat and bright pink and blue shirt memorable enough for the bar flys to remember what team I was cheering for. I will say on behalf of a few of the girls: avoid the mixed drinks because they're poorly proportioned with too much syrup and for one mojito which was made with gin instead of rum, just wrong.I cannot speak to the bowling or the LAN/internet gaming, but the former was empty and the later seemed packed.

This place is a treat! They had a great deal going where it was unlimited games for $12.99 (not including the ones that gives tickets) and that was perfect for us. Ended up getting one for each kids and set them loose. Plenty of games to play and they had this esports center that had  game consoles and tons of gaming pcs to play. I also would love to point out the surrounding area had plenty of food options and shops also a movie theatre! Great place to go if you want to escape the craziness of the strip!

The girl talking care of the party was slow, and uninterested, not very engaging with the kids, just talked to employees and texted on her cell phone.Sharice . That's the only disappointment since coming here. We had a great bartender at the party in the bowling room. I've seen the same bartender there everytime I go. He's African American with a goatie, sit in his section and order a Moscow Mule! I'm a connoisseur of Moscow Mules (lol) and he makes them better than Mandarin Oriental, Wynn, all the top places in Vegas who have them on their specialty menu. The perfect amount of alcohol to spice, taste incredible!Great place to let your kids run amuck while you drink at the bar and order food. I definitely recommend this place for birthday parties, regardless of the girl who hosted my sons party. Looking forward for my sons 9th

I got very sick after eating their nachos. 7/11 has better nachos then here. My husband ordered the wings. They were over cooked and were frozen before being cooked. Paid $4.00 for a fountain soda! Can you say way over priced! I recommend only playing the games they have .. However they need more current ones. Guess I'm spoiled by Dave & Busters. These 2 don't compare!

Their eSports employees are all top knotch. When you go in, you're not a customer. You're a member of the team. Everyone has a blast! They host reat tournaments with beyond-fair prize support. As a former LAN-Center manager, I can tell you that this place gets a lot of things right. You can swing by and even watch some of the large tournaments. They recently hosted a Hearthstone Nats Qualifier, League of Legends LCS qualifier, and have nightly tournaments. Specifically, Veronica, Nancy, and Marlon are some of their all-stars. Their team is too fantastic to name them all, but I can not praise them enough. They have become my home away from home.11/10

That's pretty generous.I went to GameWorks for a big group dinnertime outing. We didn't get any special rates, just their Dine & Play combo that's always available. For $14.99, you get one of their time cards loaded for one hour, and one of ten specially labeled items on the menu. It's also possible to do $21.99 for a two-hour card, but nobody chose that option.Like some of the others, I went with the Fish & Chips because it's normally $14.50, which is almost the price of the Dine & Play one-hour deal. I wasn't expecting much, but the cod fillets were reasonably flavorful. It's unfortunate that they seemed a little heavy rather than fluffy, and the batter wasn't as crispy as I'd hoped. I chose waffle fries for the side rather than mashed potatoes or salad, neither of which can really be called chips. The fries were decently seasoned and generally had a decent crisp and some fluffiness, but I've had better.I also sampled the GameWorks Nachos (normally $12) with steak (+$3). I suppose that the meat could be construed as ""ground steak"" instead of ground beef. Nothing in the dish was anything special. I even prefer the TGI Friday's nachos over this.I should note that they handled service for our rather massive table (20+ people) just fine, with constant replacement of water pitchers too, although condiments (notably ketchup for my fries) were a bit delayed.As for the arcade, I only partook in one round of DDR Supernova 2 because I'd handed off my card to a friend while playing pool ($13/hr Sun-Thu 4pm-close, but I think they weren't too strict on the one hour). The pool tables and cues seemed decent enough, although someone noted that one of the rails seemed to be a bit dead. Anyway, from what I saw my friends play, the arcade had a nice selection of shooting games, air hockey, a crazy souped up Pac-Man inspired version of air hockey, some rhythm games, and some racing games. I've seen worse arcades for sure.I should note that all the TVs were set to the Monday Night football game, with audio available seemingly everywhere in the building. This was fun for casual fans and for vocal Cowboys fans alike. They also have a football game-day food promo that I believe was $35 for a large (16"") one-topping pizza, 35 wings, a pitcher of soda (or +$5 for a pitcher of beer), and one-hour game cards at $5 per person. I also noticed that they offer $10 unlimited gaming on Thursdays 5pm-close and immediately wished that the social had taken place then. Oh well.I don't foresee myself coming back very soon, but GameWorks has some potential appeal for arcade gaming. Just don't expect too much from the food and you'll be fine."

Those brought back memories of going to the carnival when I was little. My teenage son  decided to go the gaming section which features online computer role playing. the price at 5 per hour seemed very reasonable.  Decided to have lunch at the restaurant. It is inside of Gameworks with open walls so you hear the machines and excitment of kids and adults. There are also multiple tv screens showing various sports programs. The food was pricy for the two items choose, buffalo chicken wrap and fish and chips $25 but it was a decent portion. Just enough to feed three, not so hungry, people. Overall the area was nice and clean. The bathrooms were clean also.

They have all the new generation consoles plus great running PCs for all your online LAN gaming needs!  They serve drinks from the bar inside the gaming lounge which is really convenient. They also have a decent happy hour after 9pm. I usually go with my girlfriend at least once a week we really enjoy it!Haven't used the other part of gameworks at all. Seems like its way to bunched together they need to open up the dining area to more games I never see anyone using the dining room anyways. Just my thoughts!

I would HIGHLY recommend Gameworks as the venue for your next party. While I agree with other reviewers that the food leaves a great deal of room the improvement the party packages and service more than make up for it.

If you are looking for a party venue I highly recommend!

The last time I've been here was when they had one on the strip next to M&M World.  I've seen nothing new except the bowling and they have billards.  It looked similar to Insert Coins.  Because they have a bar and gaming consoles for you to play on too.  I didn't like the new payment method where you have to get a prepaid card to swipe to play a game.  I like the old fashion pay with quarters.  I like they have an internet cafe where you can LAN party with your friends.  All in all, it's not that bad.

Great place for kids and adults to have a little bit of fun. The staff was friendly and efficient.

The prices are high, the games race car and shooter centric. The kids had a blast running around and playing the games. The Pac-Man air hockey was definitely the crowd favorite though. A mix between hungry hungry hippos and air hockey made for a hectic scavenging mess. It might lead to someone getting a face full of pucks, but it is always worth it to crush your rivals. The fighter jet game in a pod was also quite fun. Otherwise, I tend to go back to the tennis game. Besides the central room; there is a bowling alley, gamer room with computers and gaming systems. I didn't eat, but their drinks are really reasonable. To get a Hendricks and soda or a Bulleit and ginger beer was $16. Maybe I am so used to paying Strip prices, but it just doesn't sound too bad.

Need an activity for your double date with 25 year olds? GameWorks. Need an end of semester class activity? GameWorks. Before showing up, do a quick Google search and find yourself a deal before you show up. Groupon and even the specials on their websites have some really good deals that will give you a huge discount. For just $20 you can get an entire day of game play and a $20 game card for ticketed games if you find a discount online. It is way more expensive if you buy your ticket on site. Bring the kids here and play in the morning, come back in the evening for date night. The cards are really easy to lose and non replaceable so either hold on to it for young kids! GameWorks has a bar and quick bar food. If you come here later in the evening the average age of the crowd gets a lot older. It's located in Town Square so if you're not feeling arcade food, there are TONS of places to eat/drink outside. Park on the West side of Town Square (by the guitar shop and the movie theater)

We had our son's birthday party there today. For a couple weeks prior to I had spoken to/emailed with Samantha. She was always quick to respond & answer my MANY questions on our options. Upon arrival, she came out greeted us, got our party set up immediately in the restaurant as well as promptly set up the kids with their game cards. We were then greeted by Jamie (server) who took our pizza/drink order. There was a mistake on our order & timing of our food but the WHOLE  team made every effort to make it right. From Samantha to Charles to Ron to Chef Tommy, they all came out to not only introduce themselves but to correct the situation but make sure we knew they cared & would make our Gameworks experience a great one! And they certainly did!All the kids had a fantastic time playing & it was a great party for my 11 year old. I would absolutely recommend a party at this GameWorks! Thank you again to the staff for your amazing service!!

We had a good time on all the interactive games that were for the most part easy to understand and play for the little ones.  I do think that they could have used a few more pieces of equipment.  I understand that many of these machines cost as much as your moms Hyundai.  These machines are also very tempermental and see nothing but abuse from these super nerds who live in solitarey confinement playing Xbox 360 and only come out for cheesy gordita crucnches from Taco bell and a new Maxim magazine to masturbate to.  This is a tough crowd to please.  My suggestion would have been to put in a Jack In the Box for gamer dietary needs, instead of another sub par restaurant with high prices.  This is the last thing Las Vegas needed.  You could have used that huge dining space to put in more revenue..... or credit generators. Gameworks you are located in one of the highest rent districts in all of Las Vegas.  You have come up with away to quickly ROI for the $500,000 in equipment you purchased.  Take a lesson from the nightclub industry the way to make money is on the booze.  Bottle Service!!! and VIP AREA!!!The funnest game they had was the Pac Man air hockey.  We could have played this the whole time.  We will be back. It might be a while but we will.  Good luck to you Gameworks.  I appreciate what you bring to the valley, unlike all the other HATER SUPER GEEKS out there.

Many types of games and an all day card allowed us to play for a couple of hours go eat lunch and come back for another hour and half. Was so much better than losing at the slots.

To secure your booking, they call you and get your card info & charge you half of what's due for a deposit. When they called me about the bowling party (it took a few times for us to finally get in touch) they asked me to pick two colors for party decor. 3 days before the party, they ask if we want to add any other guests or party platters.The party was $25/kid and included 90 minutes of bowling, shoe rental, party decor, pizza, cookies, & soft drinks. Each person who RSVPd also got a one hour game card that they could start whenever they wanted, as long as it was the day of the party. There was a lot of seating & tables for all of the guests. There was even a separate table for presents. Our party of ~20 kids got 3 lanes to bowl. The food that came with the package was good enough for the kids + a few parents. The only extra food we ordered were nachos. Ebony was our server and she was so patient and friendly with our big group of 8-11 year olds. A few things you should know:The party does not come with invites; however the manager Janai sent me their logo to work with for some 'DIY' invites.Their goodie bags are very pricey at $5/kid, but again, Janai kindly let us bring our own. Overall, the experience was a fun one and I wouldn't have booked anywhere else this year.

Of maybe it's because my kid only plays the low credit games? Either way groupon usually has a good deal $10 for all day play. The only down side is  you don't accrue tickets to get prizes. But this place is a good time for both the young and older crowd and the crowd in between. They have a spot to eat and watch sports on numerous screens, pool table, darts, video games, bowling alley (very small), computer room and a private area for parties. It's a pretty cool setup and would suggest this play for family time or even a date night.

It's a lot less crowded and the service is a bit better. We decided to take my niece and nephew here on a Saturday night and it was really packed. We wanted to get the unlimited game card but you have to dine in to get the deal. I really wish they would just sell the cards without meals coz we didn't really want to eat there. We had to so we did. We went up to the hostess and told her we were a party of 5 wanting to do the dine and play. She said it would be a 20-30 minute wait and we said it was fine. She didn't ask for our name or anything so my husband had asked her if she needed our name and she was like oh yeah and grabbed a random paper. She took our name down and our number and said they'll call when a table was ready. So we walk around outside for a bit and when the 30 minutes was up we came back and checked in with the hostess. We waited another 10 minutes then we were finally sat. It seemed like they were short on people. We were sat for quite a bit when a manager finally took our order. The food was ok. We got the nachos and pizza. After that whole process, we finally got our game cards so the kids could play. Nearly all the machines and games were in use. You kind of had to stand by the game you wanted to play and wait for whoever was using it to finish so you can play it next for sure. There was a good selection of games for the small space. I think the kids had fun in the end but they were miserable having to wait for the restaurant and the food and that whole process of getting the game card.

This place is located in the back of Town Square. Plenty of parking and entry is in the front AND back. Tables in the dining area were nearly empty. Service was still almost nonexistent! When the waitress did come by, she was very laissez faire. She took orders and some items never came. We were rarely checked on in the few hours there. We didn't get the bill until we asked for it. As infrequently as we got serviced, the waitress is lucky we are honest people! Food is nothing to rave about. Typical quick fried and cooked food: burgers, fries, pizza, appetizers, salads... Plenty of tvs played sports. Plentynof tables for large groups. Side bar area for adults.Game room is a bit stuffy. Games could be updated. One side room has a few bowling lanes. Another is dimly lit, quiet, and has computers for virtual game play. Kids loved it.

It is  loud so be prepared. We originally bought 2 cards with $20 on them. After 10 minutes I realized they would be out of money real quick SO I inquired on the food and play option ($15 for an hour with one food item or $22 for 2 hrs and one food item) . You have to order select food, pay and then you can get your card. We were not hungry but since they wouldn't just sell me a card for the time, I ordered a pizza to go and brought it out to my car. With the hour/ 2 hour card it is simply good for playing. You do not collect ""tickets"" or points. I wish they would simply offer time ( no points) or per credit ( tickets earned) without having to order food. The ""prizes"" are ok. I like that you can save the card and continue to save the points."

Upgraded games/maintenance is desperately needed. Not sure if the old games are them trying to be Retro or cheap.  Restaurant is empty because the food is just okay and service is less than desirable. It's average but with potential.

Love the set up.  Lots of T.V.s. Sports bar feel with video games.  Whats not to love.  Played almost every game in the place with there unlimited hour game card.  Really fun games.  Lots of choices.  Dark escape 4D is by far the tightest game there.   I could play that for hours.  The food I thought was average bar food.  Had the buffalo wings.  Nice size wings, perfectly cooked crispy yet juicy inside.  Could of been a little spicier and saucier.  But still really good. Would order again.   Wasn't sure how it would be with all the negative reviews.  But I'll be back for sure.  Cool place to catch a NBA game.  Have a few drinks,  do a little gaming.

Only downside tons of children and teenagers everywhere. My friends and I came here for happy hour I believe 9-midnight and it was pretty decent. Happy hour beers were I believe $3 and appetizers $5-$10. We got the mozzarella sticks , pretzel bites, and nachos. Everything was a shareable size between 2 people. The mozzarella sticks and nachos were pretty standard. I like the pretzel sticks but there wasn't enough cheese and if you let them sit too long they became a little tough. Also they have a 8 lane bowling alley. No one was in there besides us so it was a very private experience. We will be back!!!

I can't help but compare any venue of the type to Dave & Busters of which there is no comparison. We came for Birthday party, they did do a good job and our server Mike was outstanding. But $11 for six slices of pizza is a bit much as we had to buy over six pizzas to feed 10 hungry teens. Buy the size of the crowd its nice to see Game Works doing well but they could reduce the dinning area to accommodate more gaming space as it was only half full at best on a Saturday night. Overall we had good time.

Granted I haven't had any alcohol or food there yet, so they might still be able to earn a star, but.. It was pretty big for where it was located. There is a bar, restaurant, bowling lanes, a computer game room, and a tiny, tiny counter in front of the prize area. Not to mention a pretty large area of general games. Opening was fun. They had a little deal going on for $12 that was pretty sweet. Now, I know that a lot of little kiddies come to TS to play and such, but the kind of games that were there...it was a little disappointing. I expected way better games and a better variety. Of course, some games were closed because they weren't giving out prizes or tickets at opening, but that was to be expected given the foot traffic they got. Though, I thought they would at least have a small raffle or something~! Some of the best things that were there were the shooting games, racing games, the virtual reality roller coaster pod, and the 4D Haunted House game!

It was was better than the gameworks that use to be on the strip near the mgm. This one is cleaner, it seems bigger or maybe its just their set up is better but its really nice. They have a video game room with up to date video gsme consoles and computers. Very cool cause its like a kids lounge area where they can chill and play video games on couches and or sit at a computer at a desk and chair and play games on there. Also they have a small bowling alley. It was small but for the price it was pretty neat. Only a few dollars per game and shoes. All the games were fun. My daughter really enjoyed the ski ball the most. Some of the games that were more credits than the others was a little bit of s rip off and the way they kept track of your tickets made me wonder because its all on a card and my daughter played for a good hour and only ened up with a small amount of tickets so made me wonder how they track how many ticketd you get per game. But the fact my daughter was having fun made me not even car. She got about 500 tickets for the entired 3 hrs we were there. She got to get 3 small toys at the prize area. The lady said she was 20 tickets over with the one prize she picked out but she just let my dsughter have the small little cup she wanted. So that was very nice customer service.  I mean you figured if im spending $30-$50 for my 6 yr old to play games there the fact they let her walk with one small free gift shouldnt be a big deal since i spent more money on the games than the toys. Lol. The toy is worth less. I guess you're just pretty much paying foe the experience not the toys. Thats a better way of saying it. I will for sure go bsck again sometime.  She liked it and I like that she liked it. I like that its right there in town square too. What a nice location. Convenient and also smart because they probably get a lot of teenagers and or kids cause its right near the movie theater and town square is pretty busy most of the time.

So this review is for them.Me on the other hand am not into video gaming so thank god this place was attached to a mall.We went on a Tuesday w our Vegas POGO passes. A POGO pass is a pass we purchased online before we hit up Vegas. It includes a bunch of kid activities for a small fee of $40 per person. This place was on the list so we came and my kids stayed for hours AND hours. Since game works was so quiet my kids stayed in the gaming room for well passed the one hour allotment. He loved it! All the staff there were friendly and very helpful.

The manager RON made our family feel warm & welcomed and made sure he introduced us to our server (Brittany-also super duper nice) for any drinks or food orders.

Jarred was our server while we were bowling. Jarred was very knowledgeable about the food menu and was spot on about the Short Ribs entree (2 big pieces of beef short ribs over a bed of creamy mashed potatoes and gravy). Wish they had more games tho. I spent about 2 hours on the new Transformers game and the jet fighter game.

This deal I'm talking about is $10 for UNLIMITED game playing from 5pm-Close on Thursdays! Awesome! I feel like they read everyone's mind because it would always be kind of pricey to play before, I feel like $20 goes so fast here and I bet that's true for a lot of parents as well. So Thursdays is the way to go! The only catch is that the games that offer tickets, well you can still play them but they don't give you tickets. Makes sense, $10 is such a steal and then you get free prizes too? No way haha That's no problem for me since I don't really care about the prizes but that definitely could be an issue for the little ones. My favorites are the football throwing game, skeeball, air hockey, mario kart and this other game that you knock down clowns with balls in an alotted amount of time. Also out of all of the games offered I think there were only 2 out of order so that's not too bad. As for the unlimited game play, you can't use your card at the photobooth but I didn't have a problem using it with anything else. Overall, I probably would only come here Thursdays now, I'll definitely be back!

It was our first time and how eager we are to go back! You have the option of $5/hr or $20 for 5 hours and you don't have to use it all at once. Save your credit for a rainy day. The young men working there are extremely fun, knowledgeable and attentive! We also ordered food and drinks.  We couldn't get enough of the amazing Mac n Chz Balls!!! And the attendants were so kind in refilling our sodas. I couldn't ask for more. My son said it was the best day ever! Thanks guys for an outstanding job!!! :)

They don't just have the run of the mill games either. The fact that MarioKart is up in there is worth 4 stars alone. Oh and if you get a shot of Patron here, which you better because this is Vegas, expect a gigantic shot because these ladies aren't selfish with their liquor. The only down side is that there are a couple kids in there and my adult ass would like to be in the company of other adults even though I'm socially awkward and won't talk to them anyway. Definitely a good spot to go to with the girlfriend or boyfriend (No judgements) just don't be in there drunk playing video games solo...it's slightly depressing lol! But hey...at least you're out of the house.

It's a lot smaller than the location on the strip. I do like how they've incorporated a card to swipe your credits now instead of actual tokens. But, it could use some improvements.

There was a lot of the same stuff in which you would see at other places, but the service itself really outshined any other place that I have been too. Dante made the experience something special with his knowledge of games and ability to assist with any questions my friend and I had. Truly an amazing experience.

It's at a really easy location to get to and away from the busy hassle of the strip.The old Gameworks on the strip was a great place but let's get real it was dying and had to be updated. I understand people's complaints about waiting and the lack of games but it's 2014 and we have to be realistic. And if your gonna be one of those people to complain about oh the lack of games cry about it.. I bet you only went to the old game works once or twice a year. If your going to be stuck up about it go try and find some where else with all the awesomeness build in one place.. And when you do please let me know.. But till then Long Live Gameworks!- Bart Sampson

Lots of games, including a room full of computers, with XBox and Playstation set-ups. The rollercoaster simulator was really fun. The restaurant and bar had friendly staff members. Typical bar food, but it was ok. You can walk around the whole place with your beer or cocktail. I don't think they need such a large dining area.

The whole different arcade games some throwbacks, current games, and interactive games with the EA sport area not mention the indoor bowling alley. Not forget about the little ones for games earn tickets then redeem them later. The whole bar/restaurant area that something like but not fan at the same time. It nice that they offer good diversity of food not your basic bar menu grub all deep fried or off the grill. I like the location of this GameWorks in Town Square Mall on the strip. I like the fact they serve beers by the pitchers as option!  I like fact that tons of televisions all over the place in the bar and restaurant area for sports. Not fan the bar area. It hardly feels like bar area that can lounge around and relax with friends. Your right smack next to the entrance so see people coming and going or kids running around. It could be good thing free entertainment. LOL. The service was awful. I went up two separate occasions the first time. Not sure if he was bartender or bar back. The guy cleaning glasses working not once did he acknowledge me. I literally was standing in front of his face the whole time. Hi. Someone will be with you. The other two bartenders just whatever I had get there attention just get drink. The bar had no personality feel like counter top in middle of open space. The restaurant area itself not much better with personality feels like more cafeteria setting I feel just open space with tables and couple booths outside. Service at times was not on it. To be fair came to GameWorks after friends wedding reception for night cap get together. Everyone showed at random times. They did do fabulous job with no reservations rearrange tables (we helped moved them or they did) ended up with over 30 peeps spread out over three or four tables. Well done. I had some of my friends food. I tried the pretzel bites. They were ok. The cheese sauce tasted out of can. The nachos that was solid. It was loaded with pretty much everything. Really all the food saw coming out to the table looked good. If playing tourist GameWorks is place that might stop by again. If want throw back days in 808 going Tilt or Fun Factory (local peeps would appreciate the shout out) would go GameWorks. The food and drinks honest so many other great spots in Town Square would skip that part at GameWorks.

The establishment is located in Town Square on the ground floor, right under the AMC Theater. There is ample parking in Town Square and the meters are used to collect donations, not to enforce parking fees, in short - your car won't get towed if you don't have change to spare. We arrived on a Thursday night at 615 pm. The dining area was practically empty apart from our party, party of 21. We occupied about five tables, but only three tables were ready to order when the wait-service came around. I was a little confused because we saw several servers and yet only one came by to take our orders. After he was done taking orders at one table, he went back to put the orders in, and took a while doing it too, and then came back for the next table. This went on until it was our turn to order, mind you we were the last table. I didn't mind that he was taking a while to get our orders but, we didn't get our water/beverages till after. I saw that he was rushing around and walking with a purpose (the dining area is kind of big). What killed me in the end was waiting for our food to come out and finally getting our check and game cards. I ordered the Cobb Salad which is a 1-hour Game Card item, the Classic Quesadilla with chicken for my kids to share- thats another 1-hour Game Card item, my husband had the Seared Salmon, and we had wings to share-buffalo style. Overall, the food was good. I probably wouldn't come back just to eat the food, as nothing really stood out. We were here to play games after all. BTW the special from Mon-Fri is that they give you 1-hour game cards when you order the game card specific items from their menu. That was a no brainer for me since my kids have too many toys at home and I didn't want them bringing more ""prizes"" home. It was about 830 pm by the time we finally checked out and received our game cards. I Checked-In on Yelp and registered/signed up for the Game Works program, so I received a coupon for a free $10 game card + 25 Bonus Points, a manager had to come around and verify my phone number in order to redeem the coupon since I didn't print it out. So of course, that took some time as well. 1-hour of gaming is a lot of time when you are with a 6 yr old and 3 yr old. I would recommend this Mon-Friday happy hour deal to anyone who doesn't mind not being able to win tickets. Not all games are ticket. I did a quick restroom trip, it seemed clean enough-there is also a gender neutral restroom for families. I spied a bowling alley, a couple pool tables, a private party room, and a bar. Cool place to bring the entire family."

The food seating area is big and pretty unnecessary. Could add more games as there looks like there's space for them. I like how there's a PC/gaming area which is nice. Also there's a bowling alley as well. Me and my friends played some games n stuff. Although there wasn't a lot of games as there was before, we still had fun.hopefully they add more games or interactive games in the near future like they had in the past.

I could easily end the review here and feel like I covered the very basic gist of what this place is all about, but allow me to get a bit more in-depth-- starting with a very short background story. GameWorks is no stranger to Sin City, having held open a Strip-side location that saw early success, but ultimately couldn't make ends meet. After a substantial hiatus, they once again returned, this time making their home in Town Square. After enjoying this location since its opening, I can safely say this was mutually a good decision on their part-- for myself and their business. Traffic rarely wanes during the summer, even on weekdays. The location itself is more suited for locals since parking is easier to come by than the Strip location, and traffic is far less of an issue. The single-level design of the arcade might be a point of contention for quite a few who knew the old GameWorks, but I find it a lot easier to navigate.The games themselves are decently maintained, not to the scope that certain Round 1s I've been to are, but enough that on any given day that few machines, if any, will ever be out of service during operating hours.The staff are generally attentive to most needs in my experience, but things of that nature are VERY different between person to person and your mileage will vary.Prices for menu and bar items are about what you'd expect. The menu has improved quite a bit over time, but the options wouldn't be enough to entice the truly picky from other offerings within walking distance. It's bar food for casual bites, not a Zagat-rated establishment.The hidden jewel of this place, however, is not the bowling alley, restaurant area, Dark Ride or the redemption counter-- it lies within the E-Sports center. Rows of consoles and gaming PCs await to satisfy the needs of more at-home gamers, with frequent community events for certain games to give the place a sense of being a hub for all that's happening in the world of competitive gaming. Of all the areas in this arcade, this one has always felt the most welcoming too.All that, and you can order food and alcohol in the E-Sports area (provided you are of legal age).Imagine all of the drunk Mario Kart games you could have with your friends...All in all, GameWorks has become a bit of a cornerstone in the gaming scene here, and it's not going anywhere. With its central location, great entertainment options and cozy E-Sports center, it's well-suited for players of all levels, casual and competitive.

It was worth it. Friendly staff and food was surprisingly good. Little on the higher priced side of food and drinks, but it was convenient. Good games options all around. Total spent was $150 for all day play. $20 each Groupon x 5 = $100 and $50 bucks on two appetizers and drinks.

I have been here a couple of times but I finally got to try the food and drinks. The food wasn't bad at all. We had a sliders trio and loaded fries! Our alcoholic drinks (blueberry martini and Moscow mule) were terrible and tasted like rubbing alcohol. The prices for the food was reasonable.On to the games:They have this crazy LAN center that takes up way too much space. This place is always crowded and none of the games are available and when they are they are sooooooo fun!Overall, this is a cute date night place and stray away from the drinks unless it's a beer :)
674|n7V4cD-KqqE3OXk0irJTyA|Igp3jiy2LzBr_eTw8WRpeA|i_DR3vdE73nVm2GlMbGpGA|Las Vegas|GameWorks|-115.1788768|36.0682585154|89119|"Oh man, I'm torn on this place. I used to go to the GameWorks on the Strip when I was kid. I mean, I even remember going to the original grand opening and losing mind because it was so amazing, two stories of video games! That's a lot for a 14-year-old boy to handle. Now this new GameWorks location is in Town Square and it's not like the one of yesteryear, but more of a sports bar fused with a Chuck E. Cheese. They added a few new things like a full bowling alley, which looks amazing, a huge bar for the alcoholic pinball lovers, and a few hundred TVs. I like the lay out here also; there are two main entrances on each side of the building, which is super convenient, and the length of the bar is great because I don't like feeling like I'm sitting on the guy next to me. The have an okay mix of games, but I feel like they need to incorporate more of the classics. They have ""Donkey Kong"" and ""Centipede"", plus a few others, but this isn't enough of the old school favorites. I hate to say it, but my age and demo will be the main customers frequenting this place and if you don't up the nostalgia factor here you might be setting yourself up for the ultimate, GAME OVER. The other side of this is most ""little"" kids or hardcore gamers would rather stay in their room and play ""Call of Duty"" with some other kid from Germany. They don't want to be bothered with socializing or paying for something they already have at home. I'm voting for Super Mario 3!Once I was done playing Skee-Ball and destroying some T-1000s on the Terminator shooter game I needed something in my belly. I still had stuff to do that day so I ordered a Cesar salad and some fries, you know...keeping it lite. These were good by ""Barcade"" standards. The salad was big and fresh and the french fries came with this cocktail sauce infused ketchup, pretty tasty! Of course I had to order a cocktail before I left, ""One Moscow Mule please"". (keeping it lite) This was actually the shining light of my visit. Sweet, tangy, and refreshing with just enough vodka and ginger. All in all, it was an OK experience and I feel like they are still working out some of the kinks, hence the three star rating. It's definitely not the GameWorks that was stuck in my memory, but I will be back to give it a second chance. Plus, who else will dominate all the little kids on the Pac-Man Air Hockey game."
675|n7V4cD-KqqE3OXk0irJTyA|fM0U0lYoQP-rJpUrylfeLA|hgAfKGJowMXeRYWgliczMA|Las Vegas|GameWorks|-115.1788768|36.0682585154|89119|This Gameworks location is great and is far better than almost any other arcade style restaurant venue anywhere near the vicinity of the Las Vegas area.  Of the comments by others that criticise this Gameworks, it is often that this location lacks some of the greatness of other or past Gameworks locations.  While some of that I agree with, the comparison should be Gameworks now compared to their competitors now, not Gameworks compared to themselves of the past.The dining areas, bar areas, bowling areas, arcade areas, and the console gaming areas all look great.  The arcade prices generally are about four credits per game, which is one dollar with no promotions or bulk purchase of credits whatsoever.  Most generic arcades in the major hotels would have similar pricing, yet Gameworks provides a much nicer, friendlier and healthier enviroment than going inside a Las Vegas hotel/casino.  In addition, they have deals, 190 credits for $27, making that one-dollar game just 57 cents.  The pricing is good; I do not see where some of these complaints come from.  It is a far better value than Dave and Busters located throughout the country.The Las Vegas design is different than many other Gameworks, but that is fine.  I personally do not understand the space given to console internet computer gaming, but that may appeal to others.  If that does not work out as expected, a great idea would be to expand the arcade space, which is what many arcade enthusiasts want to happen.  Maybe put in a clever time tunnel entrance and have some great, nearly forgotten games from the 80s and 90s in there that nearly no one has anymore (possibly locate a game list from when the first Gameworks opened, and replicate some of it).  If management wants an idea of games, I would be glad to submit some ideas, or go on killer list of videogames dot com for a blast from the past reminder of games that once existed.  Possibly, add a few more classic cabinets to overflow and transition between sections, so the place is not quite so compartmentalized.  All of this is not a complaint, just ideas to make this new Gameworks even better and enhance it with some classic nestalgia from Gameworks past.In closing, Gameworks Las Vegas does not deserve an average rating less than four stars.  Those who live in the area should enjoy what it has to offer instead of comparing it to absolute arcade perfection.  Again, compare it to what little else is present in Las Vegas family fun, enjoy the games and the environment of fun that exists inside all Gameworks locations.  I do want to also mention that in my opinion many other Gameworks, current and past, deteriorated over time.  Please do not allow entropy to set in here, please keep the games well maintained and focus on customer service and Gameworks will do well.

We had a great time. My son was really excited about redeeming his tickets and we got lucky because an employee named Jonathan M helped us out. Apparently we missed a few big ticket games, and since we still had 15 minutes, we went back and totally scored!! Jonathan got down to my 5 year olds level and told him what the coolest prizes were and boosted his confidence by congratulating him on ALL the tickets he won. :) He even talked him into sharing something with his little sister, so everyone went home happy. My son can't wait to go back because he thinks Jonathan is his best friend now. Thanks Gameworks! You have our business for life!

Every machine was Taken, so you practically have to fall in line for every game. We went on a Saturday afternoon/evening time. During the week it's probably much less busy so at least one game could be playable without having to wait. Had a done in and the service was quick and delicious. No problems with that.And I felt that there were too many racing games. Not enough 4 player games or FPS. Nice location, great atmosphere.

The restaurant area looks incredibly mundane and bland. I honestly think whoever designed this place was having a indentity crisis . I just feel like they don't know what they wanna be. Pros. A couple decent games. My son is 6 so he was impressed! Lol staff was nice and helpful. Well ventilated for all the people inside. Overall it needs work, needs more floor games, still something to take the kids to do in this town you cant beat that . If it gets better I'll def come back

The arcade portion is smaller in floor space than other arcades we have been to, and this created a bit of congestion at times.  There is also a bowling alley and a couple of pool tables.We ate dinner at the on-site restaurant.  We were a little put off by the initial customer service experience of being seated.  We almost didn't eat here.The restaurant was loud because of the arcade, there were lots of television playing sports.The waitstaff was friendly.  We found the food to be good, portion size was large, and the quality was good.  I thought the prices were reasonable for the quality and amount of food we got.I'm not sure if I would eat here again, but I would definitely take the kids here again with a Groupon.

From racing/shooting games to the ticket games! But the prizes were kinda ticketed too high for what my cousin could get on $20. Maybe kinda lower some of the prize ticket amounts an it would be good for the kids to want to come back. But this time around..was good! Went on a Thursday night. It was in the summer so it was very full with both kids and adults having fun. But my experience wasn't anything to brag about. I'm a huge games playing girl (went to fun factory - hawaii growing up) but gameworks was soooo nothing to love. Like I have no desire to go back..even if I had nothing to do. The layout was horrible. The food sitting area felt bigger then the games area! I think there was only 2 games that I wanted to play that was working. All the others were ""out of service"". Gameworks has only been open maybe a week when I went..why were the games broken? The whole design just felt like it was just put there..no thought put into the interior design. Very poor as a game fun center..didn't make it fun! Boo..bring a dave n busters!!!!!!!!"

Amazing atmosphere all around and surprisingly enough, not as loud as I expected to be (but then again it was a semi late Sunday night.) The food provided was excellent--we had a range from Pizza, wings, mini pretzels, tortilla chips, jalepeno poppers and mini sliders (which I kept coming back for, haha.) Our hosts were amazing! I forgot their names sadly (I swear one was named Lorenzo?) but the female hostess with the purple hair was extremely sweet and helpful and our male server was funny and cool as well! GW provided us free game cards and a 2 hour play card but this is a place where you get tired out at easily depending on what game you play (or what you're doing overall), so I only did a couple rounds of DDR. Noting from other reviewers, the games mostly seemed to be back in working condition, so I suppose they recently fixed everything? The only disappointment was the E-sports looked lacking (again, the time and day could have contributed to that.) Would I be back? Probably not because it is QUITE a distance from my place of residence but for special occasions, absolutely. Definitely a place to check out if you're needing an arcade fix or just a cool place to hang.

Or tossing all furniture out of the living room and getting a pool table. Still working on the first option for Mr Papagiorgio, in the mean time we made Gameworks our go to spot for playing pool.  Pros- kid can play glow in semi dark pool while you enjoy a Sam Adams. Only one of my kids likes pool, so our routine is to get a pool table, take advantage of the 14.99 for an entree and one hour game card special and send the more down to earth sibling out into arcade area, while we show off our non existent pool skills.  Everyone's happy and filled up on pizza, fish and chips, or whatever other choice kids make. Bowling alley, where pool tables are, is usually empty and mysterious, if you are looking for ambiance. Smells like feet, as God intended. There are also daily specials and happy hours and such for the value minded. Also, pool counts as PE, right? I homeschool, so PE credit is important.  Cons- pool games are far from cheap. $9/hour is making me seriously consider ditching the family poker table and investing into a nice ""I'm over my man cave"" Craig's list second hand-me-down. Another con is coordinating everything. We play at odd hours, so staff is light. Between hitting up one spot for pool balls, ordering food from another, juggling ID held for pool balls and ID required before Mr Sam Adams is brought out, it takes some logistical talent before everything falls into place. I learned to settle the bill upon ordering so that the ants in the pants sibling can get her hands on the game card early in the experience.  I just go with assumption everything will go smoothly from there and throw caution to the wind.  If you want to know about the food- it's frozen and fried, ok? Just like kids like it. Don't come here looking for culinary experience, shuffle over to Brio, you grown up, you.  In short, it's where you can take the kids when they've outgrown Chuk e Cheese, and I am OK with that."

Everything was clean and the staff was friendly. The reason for only 4 stars is a few of the games didn't work and there weren't any signs indicating this so we lost credits. Also, I used an amazing Groupon deal - I don't know if I'd come back without it. On a side note, the prize selection for tickets is great- lots of items at different values.

It was date night but there was a long pause between dinner and the movie so we tried our hand at gaming. We walked through, a lot of seemingly unsupervised teens but no issues and a few families. We decided on pool and beers. It was $5 per hour for the table and about $6.50 per beer, but of course. The table was a little rough but we weren't auditioning for ""The Color of Money"" so no worries. If the bartender had been more attentive (or the bar back to be specific), we'd have spent a lot more to keep the beer flowing. It also took a bit to check out and settle the table tab, because again, the Bar Back was preoccupied with... something, whatever it was, keeping his conversation with fellow employees on point and fairly oblivious to customers. The bar was pretty empty for a Friday evening. Overall,  an 'okay' experience for a limited one."

But they oepened at Town Square a few decades later...now, I feel ancient.The initial scent of sweaty gym socks and piss as soon as you walk in only lasts about 5 minutes then, you get used to the smell. To the left, is an area where you can pick out your prize and to the right is a virtual gaming room for those who love PC games. Straight ahead are arcade games, circus games, simulators, Air Hockey, photo booth, etc. To the right and towards the back are private rooms for events and parties. At the very back is the bar/restaurant.I've been here for a work function and so, we were in a private room. I was pleasantly surprised by the food they served us: chicken marsala, salads, braised beef with veggies, and funnel cakes. They also had more items on the menu. I was expecting pizza, fries, nachos, hotdogs and other junk. We had 2-hour game cards - those don't work on games that could instantly win you a prize (like those machines with claws that grab a toy) and the photobooth. Your time starts dwindling down as soon as you use it.I felt the need to re-live my youth and play games that I loved as a kid: Street Fighter (hadouken! Tiger uppercut! Sonic boom! Face bite! Helicopter kick!), Air Hockey, DDR and of course, Super Shot - that basketball shooting game. I would spend hours playing Super Shot...that has not changed the few times I've been to Gameworks. I get so into it like you don't even know. Sweat, focus, hand-eye coordination and a little tippy toe so i could see where the ball is going. I got hit on the head with a loose basketball by the kid 2 spaces away from me and I'm still going. I'd wake up the next day with my shoulders and calves feeling sore - but oh my gosh, it's so fun! I got people watching me when I play - I'm either such a badass at playing or there isn't a free hoop to shoot.I tried all of the other games when I got tired. I got challenged to play Air Hockey by my sister and a few other people - I owned every single one of them.But what I'd like to know is: what is that green phallic thing they have for prizes?

I've never been to the original GameWorks, but this place wasn't as bad as I had expected. My gf and I stopped by here to check out some of the old arcade and VR games. The prices are bit high for the games and drinks are pricey as well. Overall its a place to check out once.

After the opening of the competitor in downtown Summerlin, I have formed new opinions. I love that they participate in the Pogo Pass program,  love the bowling & the bar.I'm not so thrilled on their unlimited hour option, as the timer delays so you have to be very patient. You also don't retain any points for prizes with the unlimited option. On the bright side, I have seen some great deals on Groupon for GameWorks. I also like how it's a great kid-friendly atmosphere but adults can also let loose with a drink at the bar. I'm here somewhat often only for the kiddos, but I wouldn't mind checking other options for kid time.

Although it's not as big as the old gameworks on the strip, there are still plenty of enjoyable games for any age limit. Unfortunately the first game I played had a little problem and it wasn't working at all, so I wanted to speak to a manager about it because I didn't receive the points I won. The manager, Charles was so polite and friendly. He eventually refunded our points and had a tech to fix the game. It's my favorite game so far.

It's on my way home from work so I meet up with friends there occasionally. I always have a great time.  Whether it's playing the games with my friends,  bowling, or hanging out at the bar, it's fun.  The staff has always been friendly and helpful.  The food is yummy,  especially the chicken nachos,  and the bartenders are a lot of fun, especially the chick with the skull tattoo. Check it out. Make sure you play the Pacman air hockey game,  it's crazy.

By comparison,  this new location is a ton newer but also smaller. It's nice to see that everything isn't falling apart and all the games are clean and actually work!I'm not sure though why they made the restaurant area so large because Gameworks is usually an arcade first and restaurant second. I've been to multiple locations around the country and all of them have a much much larger gaming area than restaurant. The restaurant also has a ton of wasted space that could've been used to accommodate games so that it doesn't feel as cramped inside when you're playing. The only thing I like about the restaurant is the TVs and projector screens they have all around. Makes this a great place to watch sports!The games themselves are decent although not a whole lot seemed to spark my interest. Most of them are pretty expensive too, costing approximately 7-12 credits. Each credit is 25 cents unless you buy in large dollar amounts such as $50-100.Overall Gameworks at Town Square is a good place to hang out or kill some time, but wouldn't be a place I'd visit frequently.

Wish it were as big as the old location on the Strip, but this is a nice modern twist, and in a great location. Bowling, video games, photo booths, basketball hoop game (worth mentioning because its my favorite) drinks and food. Almost as good as Dave & Buster's. Kids loved it, Mom and Dad liked sitting in the restaurant area and letting the kids wreak havoc. Just kidding! We aren't *those* parents... well, at least not on that day =)

I don't feel like typing it all out again, but basically I'm giving the place five stars because I think it's a great addition to TS, and you can make a fun night of it between AMC, this, and Blue Martini. You could spend hours at TS because of those three places. Yes, some games were broken, but I'll give them a few months to work out the glitches. I also see the arcade expanding in the future because the restaurant doesn't seem to be that popular, but the rest of the arcade is. Peace.

Anyways I've been to this location more than a few times and honestly I like it.They have a bowling alley, a bar and restaurant, lots of arcade games, you can earn tickets and redeem them for prizes, billiard tables, lots of screens to catch a sports game playing, and even computer and console games area. You can play at the billiards tables for $5 an hr.Food is your usual bar food I guess there's pizzas, burgers, chicken tenders, sandwiches, salads, etc. They even have a deal where certain items on the menu comes with an hr play of the arcade for like $15 and you can use the cards anytime for 1 hr straight. I kind of have been stashing them cause I have 3 cards.Seems like a great place for families and people of all ages. Haven't had a bad experience yet and customer service has always been great. I'll definitely be back.

Having said that, I am an adult that likes to obtain the occasional cocktail, and I was pleasantly surprised with the level of service from what I can easily see as a great bartender: Erica Gueco. She was nice, personable, amiable, and attentive to my needs, all while expertly handling of the needs of the many other patrons. She is a credit to this establishment and a great person to have on the front lines. Though, with all the great food joints perched so closely to this place, and the general lack of consistency I've experienced here as far as the menu goes, I would have to say pass on the food. Just get drinks, from Erica if you're lucky.

Alot of arcades seem to be taking that approach these days (i.e. Round 1, KDB, Latitude 39). I came here for a Smash 4 Tournament and tried the arcade out between my sets.The game selection is small like many reviewers already stated, but the games they do have work well. They even have a Pump It Up Infinity that works amazingly well. I would like to see more Japanese games out here like Beatmania and Pop n' Music since the Gemini arcade palace closed. Overall, Gameworks Las Vegas is a small, underrated arcade that deserves more positive attention than it is getting.

As we walked in we were greeted by an adorable young lady who explained the different options for purchasing game cards for the children to use to play the games.  I'm not sure which ""package"" my husband purchased but it was the perfect amount for keeping the kids happy and busy for a few hours!  I don't remember the last time my kids had this much fun.  After an hour and a half or so we decided to sit down and grab a bite to eat.  The kids each got a cheeseburger and fries and my husband and I shared a couple of flatbread pizzas.  We were VERY impressed with the quality of the food we received.  Our server, I can't remember her name, was an absolute doll.  The food came out quickly and hot.  We will definitely be back to try more of the menu items in the future.  A manager even stopped by to make sure we were enjoying our visit.All in all, it was a fantastic experience for my husband and I as well as our kids who have been begging to go back since we left.  Thanks Gameworks!"

The games were all in working order, and there were plenty games to choose from. Listened to the advice of others and did not eat at the arcade. There was a great selection of games, but when they got busy, many were being played and there was much more down time. Totally worth the price with the Groupon!

I wish all the games gave tickets so they would actually play games besides ticket machines! A lot of machines were out of order. There were so many people in there you had to wait to get a turn on most games. This was Sat. at 4:00 p.m.-5:30. This place is just prepping young kids to throw away their money in hopes of hitting the 500 ticket pay out! Sound like Vegas to you?  They serve alcohol, that's a plus! They have a few bowling lanes, and kids loved that! At least they played something. They also have a small video game room with some game system for older kids. I didn't check that out much, and have no idea how long that's been there. The food is very good here. Plan on spending a lot of money if you take a few kids here at once. It's cheaper to purchase one or two large play cards than purchasing 5 different ones. So we got two and had the teens swipe for the 10 year olds. No matter how the adults feel, this is heaven for kids!

Although they don't have a DJ and dance floor like they do at Insert Coins, this was still a good time.I also liked that they had a full bar with drinks that weren't overpriced. The bowling alley also looked very intriguing, but alas, we didn't have an opportunity to bowl on this occasion. I think that this is a great option for kids and adults alike! Game On!

I've been here a few times with a groupon and without one. If they have the $20 all day passes on groupon it's going to be your best value. Includes $10 worth of ticket or lounge play too. Has an assortment of arcade games and ticket machines. With bowling alley, bar and dining area in back. The venue is big lots of room to move around. Customer service is friendly and good overall. Usually highschool kids or young gamers work the floor. The food was your typical bar food. Nothing special. Service in the dining area was very good.

Keep in mind as an adult the games should be the second reason for coming to this place and everything else ie food, drinks, the company youre with should be first. If the first is of good quality then the value of the games or their working conidition should  be second. With all of that said i always have a great time. Their happy hour, i think they have two, always hits the spot and the food is a great price and the quality is better than the strip for some items.  I kept it simple and just got the bbq bacon burger. I know, but im a burger guy. It was one of the best I've had. Sometimes you get them and they are outrageously big or dry or pricey, but this one was phenomenal.  The bartender was great at making a Cadillac margarita and quick with the food and any refills.  Forgot her name but shes on the younger side. Fun to converse with. Ill go back because im focused on Gameworks as an all around great meeting spot for first dates, friends or family looking to spend an evening or afternoon out of the house with breaking the bank.

This place is so fun and great for both kids and adults! There's a bar in here, they server food, and though it's a little pricey, it's worth every dime! It's a great idea for a night out with your friends. You can just drink and enjoy time with your friends! I recommend coming here. It's right next to the theater and Guitar Center!

Extremely organized event, unlimited gaming with the purchase of the event ticket, and free food.  Count me in!The company is always adding new games.  Last time I went there (last week), I found a new Kung Fu Panda game which was ridiculously fun.  There's a pretty good computer/lan center that hosts video game and computer game tournaments.  I'm pretty sure they do Hearthstone tournaments every other Sunday.The one thing I'm still wondering is when I signed up for ""four free hours"" of computer time during the midnight League of Legends of event, I never received those free hours the next time I came back.  Other than that, there are a good amount of games to win tickets and the prizes are great if you have a kid.  I've already won a giant care bear for my daughter.Finally, almost forgot, there is bowling.  I believe there were 8 lanes.  The games are not expensive and you can order food there.   Great place for kids and adults."

Probably not the best place for a first date. Whenever you come here it is always busy. There a lot of games that you're able to play but some of them you do need to wait especially for the popular games.

This new location is much smaller than the previous one located on the strip, however, you can still find something that everyone will like. The main gaming area has games that I haven't seen in any other Las Vegas arcades including ticket, shooter, driving, 4D, old school and Japanese games. They even have Purikura inside! There is a section for PC and console games as well as a section for bowling. The bar area is a good size with plenty of seating inside and outside of the store. The seats also aren't located next to the games so it's nice not having people constantly walk around you while you eat (unlike Dave and Buster's).The only downside is that these games are expensive because you pay with ""points."" I suggest buying the package deal where you have unlimited play for 1 hour. We were offered this deal when a friend bought a drink at the bar so I'm not sure if a drink purchase is required."

Again it was great entertainment for the kids. However I was frustrated by the many machines that were not working at all or in desperate need of repair. I was recently at a Dave and Busters where the games were newer and in better shape. Still a nice off Strip option for kids, but I hope the games are updated and repaired soon.

It's just like Dave and Buster's if you know what that is, but maybe a little better. I would definitely come back, and also suggest that you try it, cool place to hang out and there's so many other things within walking distance of this place(food,  bars, clubs, shopping, movie theater).

As an esports fan, I had to see that area. It's pretty cool to see GW recognize how big the esports industry really is. Upon entering, I was impressed by the variety, design and vibe of the esports area. I was greeted by Carlos, the manager, who told me that Alex and V (can't remember her full name) would take good care of us. They had amazing service and as we were playing Halo 5 I noticed V handle a group of loitering obnoxious teens (I rarely use this word, I'm still a big kid) like a pro. They made sure we were taken good care of. Well done everyone, will be back for sure. Very happy with my time spent there tonight.

It makes me sad. I also feel that the games take way too many credits to play especially for them to be broken. I always think ""hey lets go to gameworks"" and then I realize how bad it is everytime hahaha. Granted I hate chuck e cheese but it's way better as far as games go it also feels more liberating with actual tickets in your hand. I do prefer the people at gameworks VS chuck e cheese because it's flooded with little kids. Anyways Gameworks is ok... I guess lol"

Being new to Vegas, I wasn't familiar with GameWorks prior to my visit there or what to expect from it; I was pleasantly surprised with all they had to offer. The facility itself is HUGE! There are tons and tons of games to play, my favorite was the frog log jump and the Terminator one!! They also have ski ball and a basket ball shooting game. For those of you faithful gamers they even have an entire room set up for online/computer games where you can play til your hearts content while sipping cocktails. My favorite part is their full bowling lanes!! When you're ready to wet your whistle they also have a large full bar with a full menu. My visit happened to be their second day of being open, so their food was still needing some tweaking, however everything I ate did have great flavor. I am definitely looking forward to giving their menu another try."

Server Sahara was awesome and very attentive. Food was average and as expected.  Great place for the kids to play and have fun when it gets hot out. Better than chuck e cheese by far. One draw back is that there are quite a few games that aren't working which is a bummer when it's the only one but there were several others that were playable.

I recently attended one, where the family rented out a large room that had plenty of space for guests and tables full of pizza, wings, Philly cheesesteak egg rolls, and bruchetta. The food wasn't anything special, but that's to be expected from a place that focuses on games and entertainment. The employees working the party were friendly and attentive, regularly making sure food and drinks were restocked. The kids at the party were given cards that entitled them to 2 hours of game play on almost all games. Even on a Friday night there were plenty of games available with little to no wait times.

The four of us had dinner there and then enjoyed some games.The service at dinner was great.  The server acknowledged they had only been open for about three weeks, and they were continuing to take any feedback to improve the experience.  The shareable crab cake was delicious, but the portion needs to be shipped off!  If you get it,  don't feel ashamed to be a bit greedy as the $14 cake is just that, one expensive cake!  HOWEVER,  the chicken nachos!  You can't go wrong!   The entrees were interesting.  I got the beef rib dish.  It's not something usual for me, but I took the server's advice (he was a good guy).  I found the meat to be a bit fatty.  I found enough tasty pieces to satisfy...  The most unsettling part of the dish was the way the meal was garnished.  Imagine the sword in the stone...  But it was the rib-bone jammed into the pile of wasabi mashed potatoes.  Different.The beer selection was ok...  Just too expensive (I understand the place is on the strip).  I think I could have walked across the way to a competing place, and it would have been more affordable.The game variety was fun (I stink at video games) ,and I enjoyed pinball.  The pacman air hockey will either make you pull a muscle or lose an eye!  It is not to be missed!  After speaking to a few staff members, it's clear they are working to adjust things.  I'll give them a few weeks and will try them again.  Be patient!  I think the place will compete for your attention soon!  Huge TV and video walls will be sure have your favorite sports games available. Oh yeah, there is bowling and computer games there too (not sure what those are all about).

The manager Joseph totally blew me off when I tried to talk to him. At least act like your listening instead of just saying ""uh, huh. We got you"" . By the way I did not know that he was the manager until after my order was fixed.     . I tried to tell Joseph which computer My brother, son and I was sitting.  We waited about 30 mins for a personal size looking pizza.  Nick came and check on us 2 times as he always makes his rounds around the cafe every time I've visted.  Finally I asked for his help which he got done faster than Joseph has. Nick completely took care of my brother and son after. But he is just a great up beat worker overall every time we have gone into game works he has been helpful and always checking on the kids. Great and attentive.  Joseph it was nice giving me the reason why things weren't done. BUT NICK GOT THEM DONE FOR US. As well as the other 2 employees that was with him."

Blah.Nachos topped with steak is pretty good!The boys played arcade for an hour, while I headed to the Bowling room and sat at the bar. The hour seemed to go by pretty fast with a couple of beers.

It comes with a bar and a small dining area. Food: The food there is okay. Pricing is alright for the portions you get. I wouldn't eat here again. I would just grab food somewhere in the plaza. Location: Great area, located right next to the movie theater. You get the best of both worlds. Teenagers, kids and adults can all enjoy a movie then come here afterwards. Games: Variety of games to play. From winning tickets or just playing multiplayer. Most of the games are up to date and new. They still have some of your old school arcade games as well. A small bowling alley is located inside and a cool ride inside as well that is extra money. They even have one of those motion rides where you can seat yourself.Overall, not too bad but still feels like they are missing something.

Lets not forget their delicious food we ate Pizzas cheese and Meathead pizza's, kids favorite sliders, calamari, chicken tenders, chicken wings, and their chicken cobb salad and caesar salad was a hit with everyone.

Porky Joe's and Carnival Chicken sandwich was to die for. With some yukon fries topped with blue cheese crumbles and bacon was definitely a treat. I would also like thank the manager, Ron.

I have heard they are expanding and since I've been back, they had added several more games along with fixing the broken games. Although they may not have had what I expected, I'm still happy with going to Gameworks and playing their games.The service is pretty good except I did find it annoying when the barista in the bowling area would rather be texting on her phone or flirting with the one guy behind the bar than serving other customers. I had to ask the bowling attendants to get my drink. I understand it's slow, but it would be nice if someone looked up occasionally. But the rest of the staff are very nice and helpful.

Needless to say, there's something here for everyone, including even gaming consoles!If you're there over mealtime, there's also a bar and a full-service restaurant within the facility.  We didn't partake at the bar, so I'll leave that for others to review.  The food was average at best, and the although the hostess and waitstaff were friendly, it was very clear that none of them were enthusiastic about being there.  Even with a lot of open tables, it took over 30 minutes to seat our party, and when they did, the tables were cleared but still dirty.  It appeared everyone wanted to be working somewhere else, or not at all.  This strikes me as odd since GameWorks is located in Town Square and is essentially surrounded by other dining options.  With average food and below average staff, and access to a big variety of food within just a few minutes walking distance, it seems GameWorks might want to stick to its primary purpose and make better use of the space by putting in a small snack bar, and using the rest of the floor space for more games.I'll definitely go back with my son to play more games, but we won't eat there again.  No point paying the price for decent food but being served mediocre food when there are so many other options right there.  So go to game, not to eat.

My hands don't move that fast now but it's still fun! You have to remember that this is a place for the kiddos so it will be crazy/loud etc. If that gets to be too much, they do have adult beverages. In case you haven't been to an arcade since the 80s, they now have cards onto which they load 30, 60 minutes etc. of play time. So you can leave the quarters at home! I've been here a few times for various events, and for my birthday last year after they sent me a deal for free gaming for up to 6 people for 30 minutes and a birthday treat from the restaurant for me! That worked out as I had visitors in town who were up for some free video gaming. I'm a skee ball fan and also prefer the racing games (of which they have a few here) and so that was an enjoyable birthday stop!

The arcade is very fun for kids aged 3-8. I ended up wasting 20 bucks playing low quality and overrated games for little kids. I was more interested into the eSports games, which is near the back of Gameworks. eSports interests Pre-Teens and up. eSports has a Wii U for Smash Bros and Mario Kart 8, XBox for Mortal Kombat X and Minecraft, PS4 for Call of Duty or Counter Strike Global Offensive, and a computer that can download any playable game for free. It's very cheap for 1 hour, 5 bucks. I look forward to playing MK8 and SSB4.r

This location seems much less busy right at the opening versus in the afternoon hours on the weekends.The Party/Restaurant area:We had drove from out of state to celebrated my oldest' s birthday here. Birthday parties have many options like: dedicated packages with your own room or u can reserve a table in the restaurant area. We chose a table and added balloons, Andre was our server. I remember this because he was just so friendly and attentive! I felt like we were his only party.. Which we were not! There was two other large groups having parties the same time. It was not bad thou.There is no dedicated ""kids menu"". However we found the Pizza and GameWorks nachos are large enough for kids to share or for an adult as a meal. (The steak on the nachos was very tender and was flavorful.) Each of these seemed kid friendly and were a part of the Play and Eat combo menu (so you could have opted to get a 1 hour timed game card for about $2.99 more if you were coming outside a party package- plus $2 card activation if it's your first time getting a card). However the other menu items are mostly adult game day kind of foods or high end restaurant type meals, that would be great for a night watching sports/ or a girls night out. Not a lot of options small kids ( like hotdogs, mac and cheese etc.) I am usually an avid ""Yelper"" and had been slightly concerned prior to our arrival, about food quality and service, due to some older reviewers. My mind was quickly changed! I had to talk with the chef in advance of ordering because of food allergies and he was very professional and reassuring.  He said they had a new menu starting presidents day with several new items ( like mac and cheese balls), and that the kitchen had changed a lot since opening ( which happens a lot now that I think about restaurants I frequent). He was right that things must have changed, because the quality far exceeded the reviews I had read. I had no problem getting food everyone could eat (despite allergies) and Andre refilled my drink 4 times in the 40 mins. we sat to eat.       Inside the Arcade:Family friendly atmosphere; Plenty of room for our stroller. We even saw a few double strollers while we were there! The family bathroom has a koala changing station. However no place within this bathroom to toss a dirty diaper, other than the tiny hand towel basket? (Hopefully they invest in a solution in the future)For kids of all ages; The game floor seems to consist of several ""zones"": Many large ride on/in games, A row of bloody shoot up games , Massive flashy ticket games, A ""eSports"" LAN room which is quiet, dark and filled with a gamers wildest dreams worth of P.Cs and gaming systems, and lastly the bowling ally ( which I will go into more detail on later).GameWorks did not disappoint with more than enough things to keep everyone entertained for five amazing hours that just flew by.We had so much fun on the floor with timed cards we returned on the 15th for a second day, to allow for time in the eSports room for my older boys.eSports/ Bowling Alley:I inquired about the package options here as well for his party next year, and decided that's what we will plan for, for next time because of the value and option of pc based games like Minecraft. While here they spent 2 hours playing diablo 3 and mine craft.Overall all boys had to be dragged out in the end they were having such a good time, look forward to many visits in years to come!"

I still however love the environment. It reminds me more of a ""Dave and Buster's"" establishment with a bar and restaurant available right inside. You're able to reserve for parties which makes it perfect for groups and birthdays. If you're a hard core gamer this might not be the arcade for you since the selection of games is limited. But if your just here for fun family and games it'll be experience for you and whomever you want to bring. Service is really top notch as always.So make sure to enjoy your time here : )My review is more for the arcade portion of this establishment.everything else gets a 4 star rating."

I'm not much of a gamer myself but coming here brings the inner kid out of me. Here is my take on the place.Location: I love the new location in Town Square compared to the old location on the strip. It is below the AMC movie theatre and across from Yard House. It is close to a bunch of good bars and restaurants. Here are a few: Yard House, Capriotti's, Mcfaddens, Sugar Factory. Interior: When you walk in the front doors there is a service station to your left and a seating area, there is also seating on the exterior if you prefer that. The bar is 20ft from the front door. The bar was average in size with a good selection of alcohol, we ordered a jack with coke and Malibu mix drink, both were $6 so that's not bad. Then you have a decent selection of arcade games and various other gaming machines, there was a variation of air hockey which would throw out about 20 mini discs at once, now that was fun and intense. There was a glow in the dark pool table area and bowling lanes which I did not try but will next time.Staff: The bar staff was good. There was a hipster looking white male who made us feel at home, explained the changes to the new menu, and helped us when needed. There was a short hispanic male who was in the bar area and didn't seem to do much, I'm not sure if he was the manager but he was rude to the staff and extremely bossy. The staff at the ticket counter were good and helped us get the correct amount of points on our card after a machine error.We will be back soon to try the glow in the dark things and as the drinks are $2 cheaper than Mcfaddens which is upstairs.

(Have different ones for different days)If you remember the GameWorks that was on the strip, this place won't be as spacious and more condensed. Still offers tickets/prizes. Wish they had more games they had in their previous location :( choices pretty much were racing or shooting + the sport arcades. Keep you gamecard so with the next visit, you can reload the card and not pay for an extra.If you plan on spending some time at the bar, plenty of TV's!! The food is rather pricey, so I'd recommend waiting till happy hour (starts 9pm) You honestly can't expect any service if you're at the bar just keep that in mind. You might see someone right when you order, then they disappear.

The older location had more soul and passion. Albeit a fighting game or driving around. I love SEGA from the get go in the late 80's when I used to buy games from Tatget. LolNow their games have dwindled and the competition isn't there any more. Although it looks like they have a new LAN center to hang out at. I have yet to bring my joystick with me to this. The food is the exact same menu as the old place. Same OL same ol.

Surprisingly, the place was actually crowded. Our first order of business was to get a drink at the bar, and the drinks ain't cheap. All draft beers, regardless of type or brand, were $6.50. We ordered 2 Stella Artois and were served quick enough, but were thereafter virtually ignored by the staff.Onward to the arcade! We were disappointed when we realized we would NOT be earning any tickets for the night (because half the fun of going to arcades is collecting tickets to redeem random shit you'll never use). Anyhow, we had fun playing the games we would have never played if we were using a ticket generating game card. The arcade is smaller than I'd like- with most of the games, you had to race some 14 year old runt to play anything. I would really give Gameworks a 3.5 rating. They lose points for having expensive ass draft beers, poor service at the bar, and a limited section of games. All in all though, I would still return if I'm ever in the mood for it. I'll just get my drinks elsewhere!

We opted for an hour unlimited play, which we understood that we wouldn't be getting tickets and about 12 machines that weren't valid with our pass. However, there were a large number of machines that were out of order. Especially a lot of the driving games with 2 player options had 1 player not working.  I feel like the maintenance of their machines used to be a lot better, or maybe the machines are just getting old and they are due for new ones. We still had fun with the ones that still worked, but I was pretty disappointed. They also have a bar here with reasonable prices along with a menu for food too.

We wanted to check it out and take the kids to do something fun before school started back up. We are locals and this was our 1st time going to Town Square and to Gameworks.   Loved Town Square. .I will have to do another review on that. We entered Gameworks from the bar/restaurant side.  The bar area is pretty big.  On the opposite side of the bar is a huge area for dining.  In fact i think that area is too big.  They should probably reduce the dining area by half to make room for more games. The gaming area was not what i expected it to be.  I mean they had some cool games but i thought the area would be much larger.  The computer gaming room was pretty cool.  My son wanted to play but we didn't get a chance.  It was only $5 an hour to play on the computer. ..next time we go I'll let my kids play in there.  There was a bowling alley in a separate room...we didn't go check it out tho. We didn't eat there this time around so I don't know how the food is. They could do with getting a few more shooter games as those are the kind of games my kids like.  We spent $54 on a play card with 400 credits which was enough for the 3 kids.  Next time we will spend a little more.  Overall this place is pretty cool.  My kids had fun and wanted to stay longer. On the next visit my husband and i will get some food and drinks while the kids go play.

It was clean and well-managed and the service was exceptional. Rami took especially good care of us (one of my youngest was scared on the 3D ride and she stopped it, took him off and then restarted it for my other kids so they didn't miss a thing). And when a game didn't work, they took care of it right away. Even the toys you buy with tickets are better quality then most in places like this.

I understand they had to make changes after moving from the Strip.  But my expectations were so much higher.  You walk into the new location and it almost seems empty.  There is a lot of square footage, but not enough games to fill the space.  I am not a gamer.  But I do enjoy sports, driving, and flying games.  They had a bit of a selection, but it seemed like there could've been so much more.  My experience here was okay, but I don't see myself coming back anytime soon.I hope as time goes on, GameWorks is able to get to something near what the Strip location was.

I won't lie, the 3 tacos for $5 sign out front was what drew me in. For the price, the tacos were good. I mean really, you can't even get 3 tacos at Taco Bell for $5 and these are better than Taco Bell.So the restaurant is at the back of a bakery/café called Café Desserts Etc. The decor looks like a bakery and not so much a taco joint, but hey whatever.It's the same staff working both places and the menus are combined into one.So the 3 for $5 tacos were the Picadillo tacos the day I went (the cashier had to ask the chef what the special taco was, so not sure if it changes daily, or she was new and didn't know). The tacos were on a corn tortilla (I love corn tortillas! Many Mexican fast food places use flour tortillas, boo!). They were filled with ground beef, potatoes, lettuce and sour cream. There were 3 different hot sauces that you could add to your tacos. I tried all of them and liked the green one the most. The beef itself was minimal and yes, somewhat reminiscent of Taco Bell, but the taco was tastier and much more interesting than a Taco Bell taco. The potatoes added an interesting texture and taste, and the sauce they were cooked in was flavourful.Listen, you're not going to get gourmet tacos for the price. I went in expecting fast food tacos and with such expectations, I was pleased with what I got. Staff were pleasant and the place was clean.I would go back.

Looking around, we noticed the adjacent dessert restaurant had displayed the Don Taco menu on its window and that's when we realized they must have been conjoined? Confused, we looked at the menu: it seems promising. And it was a Tuesday, so there was a deal on tacos ($1 tacos). We went in.The place didn't feel at all like a Mexican restaurant since, after all, it was in a dessert shop. We felt a little out of place when we sat down, with the bright pink juxtaposing the black and white furniture. The couches and chairs were comfortable, though. I ordered 4 tacos, which were their generic taco formula of ground beef, potatoes, lettuce, and cheese. My boyfriend had one taco and a picadillo burrito. The food was served promptly and warmly, fresh and promising. The tacos looked like tacos, and the burrito was wrapped in tin foil. I took a bite out of my taco and received mixed feelings: while the shell was weak in its rigidity and almost wet (lacking adequate crunch and satisfaction), the taco filling was delicious. The ground beef had  the right amount of flavor that was balanced by the lettuce and cheese. The potatoes added an additional surprise and savoriness to the overall taco, making up for the taco shell. My boyfriend's picadillo burrito though was absolutely scrumptious. If we go back, I'm definitely getting one of their burritos.

We ended up getting cow tongue tacos which were delicious and since it came with a combination of rice and beans we paid very little for a really filling meal. The beans were a little watery and the rice wasn't the most flavorful but overall the food was really great and the service here was great as well. Having a wife who is part Mexican can sometimes lead to some heated discussions around good Mexican food and I have to say that she enjoyed the meal which was a surprise for the middle of Canada.

Don Taco is small little place with few seats but I get the feeling that this place is more of a takeaway place than dine-in. The tacos here are pretty good and the staff are Mexican; and from what I'm hearing the food here is really authentic Mexican.

So I'm thankful for whatever confluence of disparate events that led to the existence of Don Taco - this miraculous Mexican food shelter serving 2-3$ amazing and delicious corn tortilla tacos. I'll call it authentic, and your eyes will start to roll from how cliche it is nowadays to call something authentic. Yet I swear they'll unroll as soon as the flavours of an Al Pastor taco reach the tip of your tongue. Keep in mind it's a tiny place, so either be happy eating while standing at the small counter/bar, or take your food to go. This is a great place to stop by for a quick snack while you're doing the million things you can be doing in the downtown core.Whatever you do don't miss it!

It's a little tight on space but the feeling of authenticity was completed by my almost complete inability to understand the jolly and pretty cashier's accent. Cheap prices, easy access but there isn't many tables with a lot of space. So if you're 4 or more, forget it.Don't judge a book by its cover. The cover is admittedly pretty sad considering how small the joint is making it incredibly easy to ignore while walking by.

At best it was average, and by average i mean extremly mediocre food that wasn't overly authentic. The prices are reasonable, but i guess you get what you pay for.The tortilla tasted store bought, we heard them heating up our beans in a microwave and the rice had absolutely no flavor nor aroma. The tacos were OK but nothing you'd run home and tell your friends about.This quaint looking restaurant can pass you by if you blink too quickly. It seats about 10-12 people, so if you're a big group I'd cross this place off your list.Would i go back? Probably not.

Very friendly service, freshly made food, hot and tasty.  The price is incredible, just 1.75 each for most Tacos, and on Tuesdays, which I just came from yesterday, they have a $0.99 special per beef-filled taco.  The Tinga so far is my favorite, shredded chicken, lean and delicious. Choice of hot sauces offered at the serving bar, the red one's my favorite, and it's got kick.  Small place, only a few tables, but has a bar with seats along the side that is convenient.  What could stand improvement is perhaps how orders are placed, which has resulted twice now in small mistakes in the food order, but after which they immediately fixed.  Possible solution is perhaps by offering customers a ticket number so that we can help verify the order when we get it as well? All in all though, the combination of price, service and quality of food makes this place outstanding. I'm a fan

Catherine Street West in the Shaughnessy Village area of downtown Montreal. I accidentally came across this place one day and was surprised with their taco offerings. It is difficult to get tacos in Montreal so this was a good find. It would appear that it is paired in the same location with a bakery (not reviewed here). The first time I came here I had two tacos from the menu, the Alambre and the Asado, an order of hot pimento peppers and a coke for a little under $9.00. The Asado taco was tender grilled beef served with onion and coriander. The Alhambra was a sauteed chicken taco served with red and green peppers,onions and melted cheese. Both were served on a soft shell corn tortilla. Both were excellent but a little on the small side. I also had a side order of hot Mexican jalapeno peppers. They were precisely that, I could only eat two or three, they were so hot. On a Tuesday I returned for the .99 cent Dorado taco special. These were ground beef tacos served with lettuce and cream. They were small yet tasty tacos. I also ordered a side order of refried beans.  This made for an interesting cheapie night paired with a movie at the old Montreal Forum (Pepsi Forum) a few blocks west at Atwater. The decor was very clean and the toilet was extremely spacious, modern and ultra clean. It would appear that the women working here are hard working and dedicated, more power and success to them!

The tacos are nice, cheap, and legitimately central american. When I first discovered Don Taco I ended up going there something like 7 times in 2 weeks (don't judge :p). The food is always good and reasonably fast. The staff are super nice even when I've F'd up my own order. I've run through the menu of tacos, and dipped into the burrito menu. I have to say the fish tacos are really the standout. There can be no regrets with tacos. For now Montreal's taco battle is firmly Don Taco vs. Cafe Frida.

I had three tacos; shrimp, fish and shredded chicken with a side of rice and a side of beans. Each taco was loaded and all the ingredients tasted fresh. My boyfriend had the picadillo burrito which was HUGE. We shared some of their home-made lemonade which was a great thirst-quencher. The space isn't that big, with only two or three tables for two and one bar with stools along the side of the restaurant. They make the food Dailey quickly so it's decent for takeout! Highly recommended!

The steak was quite flavorful and the serving staff are friendly. I've been accustomed to the burritos from burrito boys or fat bastard so having a burrito that doesn't leave you fully stuffed was surprising to me. But the flavors are simpler and quite nice from this place. 3.5/5 stars!

Why not blend them together in one sweet spot in the Concordia ghetto. One block away from from 3 amigos takes a lot of courage.Glad to say it passed the test for me, it is very fresh and tasty. The burritos are not gigantic just right sized for me. The choice of sides are mushed up beans, salad and rice with corn.The price per plate is under 10 dollars for most items, even steak and shrimp.They have 3 soft tacos for $5The only downside is the lack of spices so make sure to ask for the sauces trio to complement the burritos and soft tacos.

The prices and the portions are great.Their burrito is a bit bland sometimes so I definitely recommend getting the tacos instead. It's a nice place to sit and eat. If you don't go at peak hours it's quiet and spacious.

Located in a shared space with a cake maker, the food was way, way authentic.The food tasted amazing. Had the tacos Pastor with rice and beans. Well made, home made, fresh spicy salsa. I'm very pick about my Mexican and I have to say, this one passed.It's a no thrills place - no bar service and small but that's fine with me.If you want authentic flavor and not too expensive, go here.

The plating is not as fancy and the portions are not as generous as at Maïs, but for such a cheap price I won't complain. Love how the tortillas have crispy edges. They don't put too much sauce or seasonings, which really brings out the natural flavors of the ingredients, but it can make you feel like it tastes a bit bland...Great spot to grab a quick and cheap lunch :)

I love the flavour of all their foods. The best ones is their make your own noodle bowl, and their steamed rice. Their breakfast options are okay - wish the toast would be crispier. The service is better this time, at least our waitress did not get our drinks or our food orders wrong. Gneerally some of their staff needs to improve on their attitudes towards their customers. I get that it's a SUnday afternoon and you are busy, but there is no need to roll your eyes at your customers, especially when we as a large group already agreed to splitting up in order for her to seat us easier (yes i'm talking about the hostess). Anyway love the food, but they really need to work on their service... one of the rare occasions where i had to consider cutting my tip or no tip.

It seems as though every single restaurant that takes up this space fails to last. This space once was some sort of western style restaurant, then it turned into a AYCE sushi place, eventually into an a la cart sushi restaurant and now finally a HK Style Cafe. It's almost like this space is cursed.Anyhow with the history lesson aside let's begin! My disclaimer is that I never had great expectations prior to going in and you shouldn't either. The very idea of HK Syle Cafe equates to affordable and decent tasting food that is served fast. And with that I believe this place delivers. I won't say the food is mind blowing in any way but it does the job. Some dishes are strong (like stir fried noodles and rice) while others are a bit weak (baked rice, soup noodles..etc) but what this place does have is variety. The menu is vast and very creative with enough variety to satisfy anyone. Another plus is the affordability; you get enormous portions for Scarborough prices. As if that's not enough of an incentive, they offer all guests a free dessert at the end of your meal. The desserts they serve are not the rejects either (unlike most places where they serve those red bean/green bean porridge crap that noone touches).The service is attentive and pleasant the last few times I have been there. No complaints. I just hope this one is here to stay and break the string of bad luck this space has endured.If you're hungry and need your HK Cafe fix, stop by.

Anyways, they sit us down and we ordered. They have few menus put on the tables but somehow they are duplicate menu that printed n looks different but the content are the same.

It has change so many times I probably haven't been to half of what it were. But now that it's a HK style cafe, and seems to have quite the business, I thought I would give it a try. To be honest it is pretty average for a HK style cafe. Very typical food offered but they do have things that are really random. They offer the typical HK style breakfasts like macaroni, toast, instant noodles, etc. They also have congee and rice dishes, even poutine! (Some of the cheese curds were kinda rubbery but it's not bad) Price-wise it was decent, nothing out of the ordinary pricing for these kinds of food. They have a lot of space and a lot of staff so there always a seat and quick service. There is also free newspaper for customers to take home!

The place had 4 customers besides me and my hubby. I ordered a chinese breakfast, consisting of daily congee and a choice of dim sum. I got the pan fried turnip cake. The congee was peas and sliced fish. It was ok, bit bland and watery. My husband got a bowl of soup rice vermicelli and an egg sandwich. He said his food was ok. The prices are cheap here and food is ok, not great, but you really can't expect much for the price you pay. They offer lots of dim sum choices too but why get frozen dim sum from here, when you can buy some from T & T and steam it yourself. Ok for a quick bite to eat, if you can read chinese, you can get a free newspaper too.Er, no I haven't been back since.

Probably the most delicious sweet and sour pork I've ever tasted. Once I've tasted this dish I never bother ordering it from other places.The dishes I've ever ordered from the restaurant always come in a large portion. Tasted pretty good too. Except for one time when I ordered stir fried vegetables with mushroom it was lacking in flavour as it was too watery, as if the sauce was watered down. But nonetheless I'd go back again to try the other dishes.

They continue to provide delicious food and service. We enjoy trying new items on restaurant's menus. Especially restaurants like Kitchen M with a large menu. Tonight we arrived around 7:30 pm after church and was seated at a nice table because the waitress knew that I need good space because I'm not a skinny man. We were greeted with a smile and the waitress wanted to make sure we were comfy. We received our soup less than 5 minutes after we ordered and the plates started coming after that.We ordered 4 dishes all together and some steamed rice. We had green beans in a garlic sauce, General Tsao's chicken with delicious mixed vegetables, Sweet and sour grouper and Shredded duck and vermicelli noodles. It was all so delicious! Sweet & Sour Grouper:The grouper was lightly battered and fresh and tasty.. mixed in were thin onions with shredded carrots. The sweet and sour sauce was perfect, not too sweet. Stir Fried Green Beans in a Garlic Sauce:The green beans were stir fried with a delicious garlic sauce. The beans were cooked properly, not mushy.. just a perfect crunch when eaten. The sauce mixed perfectly with the steamed rice.Shredded Duck with Vermicelli Noodles:Another tasty dish. Mixed with onions and carrots, it came piping hot! We enjoyed this because the duck was cut up small, not big chunks like we've had in other restaurants.General Tsao Chicken:This dish was excellent as well. We probably wouldn't ordered this again because we were hoping it was a little more spicy. We are not big fans of General Tsao Chicken, but we wanted to at least try it. The chicken was tender and tasty. Mixed with green peppers and onions.Dessert:Two desserts came with our meal. My wife choose the Mung beans dessert and I had the Mango pudding. An amazing end to the meal. The restaurant is not a fancy restaurant. It's loud and there's lots of action! Lots of families enjoying their meals and the people gathered with them. Like at home. We like the buzzer system they have on the tables. We rang for ""Drink Service"" because I wanted some cold water. Two minutes later... bada boom! I was enjoying my ice water! We like Kitchen M and will keep going because, it's not hard on the pocket book.. and most of all the food is excellent!"

A large comfortable place, definitely started off rocky but it's steady and will reach new heights in the future! Will come again :)

I often come here on the weekendbfor breakfast so coming in on a weekday was interesting. Firstly, I love how big it is! This helps with the ventilation. I hate smelling like teppanyaki so having this giant space really helps that smell not to be woven info every fabric I'm wearing that day. Second, I know that this is not exactly revolutionary but for a cha chahn tang (茶餐廳) it was a step ahead. They have a little machine on each table so you can press the button to order, get a bill, cancel an order, and something else. It makes things really efficient because once you press it, it makes a little chime sound at the ""control station"" and they send someone over. If you wanted the bill and you're in a rush, this could help cut down on the time. Anyway. We ordered 3 breakfasts for the 2 of us. Their potatoes were absolutely fab. Yeah they're fried but they still taste naturally potato. Breakfast sausages were delicious and not drowning in oil. Yum! This place has my favourite preserved egg and pork congee. They only have it for breakfast time (why not all the time?!). They have a lot of toppings, the congee is thick enough so you're full, but it isn't like you're eating congealed slime. The congee has a lot of the preserved egg and pork taste but WAIT. What's spectacular is that the toppings actually taste like what they are supposed to be! Usually when you make congee with toppings, the congee had all the flavour but the toppings do not. BUT this place had one of the best congee ever. Everything had taste. Definitely recommend the congee and pan fried rice roll breakfast combo. Also the one with potatoes and breakfast sausages. They give you 3 links. One star taken off because service was average for cha chahn tang. Food was delicious."

The atmosphere of the restaurant itself is quite relaxing.  Lots of open space and comfortable seating.  My family and I went at around 7 PM and there were plenty of tables open, so we were seated fairly quickly.  The menu offers a variety of choices, from individual items to set meals for larger groups.  They also have lunch and dinner specials for a good price.  I was excited to see an all-day breakfast section (because come on, it's never the wrong time for sausage and eggs), but that quickly changed when I realized that there were only two items in that section.  What a tease.  We opted to order a bunch of dishes to share, so we got a beef curry with spaghetti (that interestingly came with a side of croutons, cheese, raisins and sunflower seeds), soft-shell crab fried rice and two noodle dishes.  I was most excited for the fried rice, but it ended up being pretty bland and overall disappointing.  The curry was tasty, but I didn't have too much as my spice tolerance is basically non-existent.  The other noodle dishes were good, but nothing amazing.  We ended off the meal with a dessert of green bean soup, which was quite tasty.The service itself wasn't the greatest.  The restaurant wasn't packed by any means, but the waitresses didn't seem very attentive to our needs.  We had to wait a while for anyone to come and clear some of the finished plates off our of table.  Same goes for refilling our tea.  Overall, nothing too special.

There were mutiple menus to look at making it difficult to choose something somewhat. However, also a good thing being that there were many different assortment of options to choose from. I ordered the Black pepper chicken with spaghetti for 9.95. The chicken came out perfectly hot and crispy, and quite juicy. The sauce was really peppery, which I like. I like the fact that almosy every dish comes with soup and a drink. Comparably, the prices are fairly good and I find the food alot better than Hollywood. I would definitely comw again to try other things.

They have so so so many choices. I am not exaggerated. Definitely true. It is a great menus which overwhelmingly cause people like me indecisive or mind changing on food orders. It makes you wanna return again for other choices.  Love this part as we customers have more options.  My Kitchen is an authentic HK style tea and food restaurant. Afternoon menu start at 230pm, small portion for noodle in soup for hungry lady like me. I really like their red bean French toast, I can only find it from here.Definitely a wonderful addition of HK style tea house in Markham.  I love it spacious and order buttons so you don't have to wave your hand or scream out loud. :) love their French toast thick one . They did a good job and make me return 2x at least . One star lost because from my visit history their size of any afternoon tea set soup noodle is always smaller  than other regular items and the quality of ho fun can be improved. I rather spend a regular price for a decant size of noodle.  Try their French toast with red bean from the afternoon set menu, it is my favorite not overly sweet. Their Milk tea are okay. not better and worse. It is generally an acceptable cheap eat place and adequate service. The greeter from the bar is always so welcoming as soon as you walk in ( if the young man is working) :)

It runs from 9-11am on Fridays to Sundays (9:30-11:30 Mon-Thurs) and you can match 2 items on their breakfast combo menu + drink for $5.95. The portions are a great size and you leave feeling full! The service is super fast. We ordered and received our meals in 10 mins. I got the two eggs and sausage with butter toast with the ham macaroni and everything was delicious. A very clean breakfast since nothing was too oily or fried and still super flavourful. We arrived pretty early at 9:30 so there was no wait at all but I've been here before around 10:30 and it could get crowded from all the people trying to make that 11am breakfast special cut-off.What's a plus as well is that they give complementary Chinese newspapers that you can take with you for someone who reads them (if you don't yourself).

This place is pretty consistent and their milk tea is on point.  That's what makes or breaks a HK style cafe. If their milk tea sucks,  then I won't be coming back.  But I give this place a thumbs up for their milk tea. Nice and strong. Couple be a little bit hotter though. Their afternoon tea menu has gotten better. I remember  when they first opened it was a bit lacking and the choices weren't as great. I noticed they improved it... I'm willing to try more. Overall, opens early and closes late for snacks. Great job!!! I will be a regular here.

Walked right in and got a table right away. I knew what i was going to order from looking at the menu last time i was here. (Soft shell crab fried rice).MMmmmm, was not disappointed. The place was not extremely busy, but busy enough. The staff was much friendlier this time around.  Push the button, and they came right away!Quantity of food was good!!

The menu had a huge selection on items which was good but it was very hard for me to choose since I wanted to try everything. Tried the chef recommendation which was the shrimp fried rice for $13 and it was good. The portion was ginormous which i had to take home as the waitress told me this can feed for 3 people. Also ordered the chicken skewers and they were alright. I really enjoyed everything about it except that it closes early. Will be back for round 2!

A typical lunch would be around $11 plus tax.  The decor was your typical modern design with a slightly dark grayish floor with light colour table and slightly darker chair.  The lighting is soft and not too bright.  They have way too many items on their menu.  It took me a while to go thru all the items.  I decided to have to steam rice with shrimp wrapped in lotus leaf.  It was 15-20 minutes wait, and i waited a bit longer than all my friends at the table.  The meal offers either Chinese soup or English soup. lol!  I prefer the Chinese one since it is usually a soup lighter in a style of light consomme.  I had the typical milk tea as the after meal beverage.  The rice was really fresh and tasty.  It has the rich shrimp aroma throughout the rice and slightly floral smell from the lotus leaf.  It was definitely good.  Service was not bad since one of my friends is a regular here.  Although a little pricey for this style of food, but it was worthy.

If the fact that it's owned by the guy who owns Ming's (another popular HK cafe south of Pacific mall) doesn't peak your interest, then maybe the thousands of dollars of expensive iron man figures will? No? Well let's talk about the food: it's typical hk style level. I tried two breakfast specials for the sake of this review - luncheon meat instant noodles and corn beef egg sandwich with oatmeal. Both are average in taste and portions. But for $6 each what do you expect? Fast, efficient, service with economical typical dishes.

After passing by this place at least 10 times a week, I finally saw the open sign lit on Tuesday. Since I was busy yesterday, I decided to wait until tonight to eat here. For 9pm, this place was ridiculously busy. However I assume it was full of people who wanted to try this place for the first time, so I'm not expecting the full seated load to last. The menu here is very extensive. There was your typical HK style cafe options, as well as dim sum. There are two featured items on the menu which are also advertised outside the restaurant along the wall facing Highway 7. I decided to try one of them, which was the Shanghai style beef noodle soup (forgot the exact term).As we were waiting for our food, one of the employees gave us two 10% off cards, which are valid until January 31, 2015. The meal itself was also 10% off for their grand opening special.The food took a good 15-20 minutes to come, however the iced lemon and iced milk teas both came rather quick. The milk tea here seems to be better than the lemon tea, as my dad found the milk tea to be good and I found the lemon tea to be mediocre. As for the noodle soup...it was also mediocre. Edible at least, but definitely not what I would say memorable.There are a lot of other items in the menu that could be worth trying, but I'm gonna wait for other Yelpers to review this restaurant before considering coming back.

I think it's pretty decent and maybe better than Phoenix. Kept most of the design from previous Japanese restaurant. Clean, good service, good price, good portions. I got the soft she'll crab fried rice ($12.95) and I thought they would give me tiny pieces of soft shell crab and have to dig for them but there were actually many pieces ans big too. Overall I give this place a good thumbs up. Dine in guests also get free Chinese news paper (either Ming Pao or Sing Tao), that's a dollar savings on its own!! They have specials for everything, and dim sum too. But during hi-tea hours (around 3:15pm) it'll be the busiest so be ready to wait a while.

Extra star because I value good service, and, for an Asian place, they definitely went above and beyond to merit that.  Plus, I have yet to come across a place that serves tofu fa as dessert...so that was a pleasant surprise!Ordered some standard stuff: a pork chop rice and some beef spaghetti dish.  Nothing special re the pork chop rice.  Same goes for the spaghetti.  Only thing is, either the wait staff or the kitchen messed up the meat on the spaghetti (i.e. they put fish instead of beef), and we sent it back.  They were SO GOOD about fixing the dish to the correct order.The HK milk tea and lemon tea that we ordered were ok.  We'll come back again and try other dishes!

In true HK cafe style, the menu is ginormous - classic Taiwan dishes, ramen, build-your-own noodle soup and of course, the HK classics. I decided to order none of these on this occasion and order the poutine. Unexpectedly delicious! The fries are exactly what you think - huge and super crispy in true Chinese restaurant fried style. The gravy was lighter than your traditional beef gravy and a little less salty which was nice for the body. The hot gravy + hot fries meant that the cheese curds were perfectly squeaky and perfectly warm. The milk tea here is also pretty decent and really a must have. This place does get pretty busy so expect a moderate wait if you're coming on the weekend!

The short haired lady with the bob is pretty rude. When she took back our menus she just threw them onto the table beside us loooool. But the other one is pretty nice so she makes up for it.

I ordered the baked beef brisket and spaghetti in Portuguese sauce.This is more or less my go to dish at these hk diner type places. I can't say it was the best one I've had but I can't say it was the worst. The meal comes with soup and a drink. I got the veggie soup and cold hk milk tea. The portions were pretty big. i forced myself to finish my meal and was absolutely stuffed. the pieces of beef brisket were huge, definitely not bite sized chunks. the Portuguese sauce also had potatoes and corn in it too. The spaghetti was cooked well.Because it is close by, and the options for hk diners within the 10 or so minute radius from where i live are so limited, I'd come back.

If you haven't, let me tell about the french toast I consumed on my last visit.For $4.95, imagine a melted layer of peanut butter-y goodness sandwiched between two slices of crustless, brick toast. This combination is then dipped in egg and DEEP FRIED to a crispy golden brown. On top sits a pool of thick condensed milk. Salivating yet? This decadent snack is not for the faint of heart (or for those at risk for diabetes).Other food I've had here has been okay. The portions are quite generous and the  breakfast/lunch/afternoon tea specials come with coffee/tea/soy milk. Lots of seating, and like many HK cafes, you have to wave down the staff if you need anything.The only thing that was super gross was the tape of dead bugs hanging above our table. Also, the wifi isn't very reliable. But there's lots of choice and something for everyone. Great for groups :)

The service is quite good to be honest, and the restaurant itself is fairly spacious (unlike Phoenix and others). Their milk tea is tasty and the food is above average. Nothing that will knock your socks off but that's hard to find at establishments like these. I've had a few things from their menu, and today I tried to Korean style pork chop cutlet with rice. The pork chop was fried really well, a nice light batter and not oily at all. I really enjoyed it. Came with a soup and tea. The pricing is on par with other HK style cafes, but you also get a free newspaper if you're into that. Lots of competition in the area, so I expect them to remain competitive and provide decent service.

The Hong Kong style milk tea was also great.The Peking duck was ok, it wasn't as crispy as I have had it from other places. We were also served a whole fish, a soup, a seafood vegetable dish and noodle soup and they were also acceptable. At the end of our meal, we were waiting for our desserts, but we were told they only have dessert at dinner, but we had called about this meal and they said they're able to serve it at lunch and no where in the advertisement did it say dinner only. We were given some sort of kids' mango yoghurt dessert as a replacement, better than nothing I guess.I am however, a bit confused as to what kind of restaurant to classify this, because my family had a 5-course Peking duck meal, something you usually get from a Chinese restaurant, but most of the menu, and the decor suggests a Hong Kong style cafe. Confusion aside, there's an array of items on the menu that will probably take you long to decide. Variety is the spice of life and if you're with a group of people who can't decide on one kind of food to eat, this would be great place to take them.

We had the sweet and sour pork, mushroom beef slices, BBQ pork vermicelli soup,  fried pork chop, and veggie dish.  The food was good.  All around decent flavor and the soup noodle broth was delish!The free starter soup is super yummy (was told no MSG) and free dessert in the end was a nice touch.  The soya bean dessert was no good, but the mango pudding was good.The servers were really friendly.  Child-friendly atmosphere.

In my opinion, when a restaurateur aims at a certain market, whether the restaurant is good depends on whether it delivers delicious food in a hygienic environment, and fulfils the expectation/norm of that market.  If it exceeds expectation, great, but IMO, ""good"" only requires meeting expectation.  Maybe my expectation of a HK cafe is not particularly demanding.  Maybe I have missed the poorly reviewed period of the grand opening.  During the first visit recently (in 2016), I find Kitchen M meeting expectation of a HK cafe..  The food is flavourful, the portion is satisfying, the pricing is on par with market, the value is sufficient, the ambiance is pleasant, the staff is efficient.  Kitchen M is great for lunch and a value dinner.  The food isn't so good that it could demand high prices, and Kitchen M doesn't charges high prices.  Here you go: it is A-OK."

I must say that they have a lot of variety of food in comparison to other HK style cafe. Their food is alright and their price is reasonable. The only thing that I would say don't order from there is their Ramen. I appreciate that they offer something different but Ramen is just not their thing. The soup base was weird and their noodles was not the typical Ramen.

It now shares a home with Auntie Anne's Pretzels which is another guilty pleasure of mine. I can't stop at the mall without stopping here. I usually stop here first, stuff my face, and then burn off the calories while walking around and doing shopping. It's a win-win for everyone! Well maybe just for me.I like watching the workers make the cinnamon rolls from scratch. They use so much butter and cinnamon in the dough, and then when those babies come out of the oven they slather them with delicious cream cheese frosting. It's delightful. I usually order a classic Cinnabon, or I get the Cinnabon stix which is their cinnamon roll cut into strips, and then served with their cream cheese frosting for dipping. I always double up on the dip, too. They also have the center of the roll, which is exactly what it sounds like; the center of the cinnamon roll. You will need a fork and knife to eat this. And another fav is Pecanbons which is the classic cinnamon roll with caramel and nuts added. Besides treats, they also have iced and hot coffees, lemonades, and chillattas which is like blended coffee drinks. If you aren't into sweet, you could go savory and get a pretzel, see my next review for that.

I'm a vegetarian and i've always enjoyed the meals there although they don't have a ton of choices. It's byob which makes this an inexpensive albeit unpretentious and elegant restaurant. Most of all, I enjoy the pace of the restaurant. Everytime i've gone, I spent about 2 hours there, dining slowly and enjoying. Afterwards, a walk to the river. Nice.

I try not to be a food snob, I really do. I can grub on pizza, nachos, and fries and wash it down with a lite beer. But sometimes I just gotta have my foodie food, and most recently I got it at River Moon. The greek appetizer was generous and fresh, the halibut was beautifully done. But the cannolli was the best I've had. Pure rapture. We had the pleasure of meeting chef Josephine, and she's as warm and welcoming as she is talented. This is a great place, so good you might want to save it for a special event!

River Moon Cafe!  Anyway, this is a tiny little place located basically in the middle of nuttin.  They have nice choices for brunch.  I opted to start with a nice glass of mimosa that was served with a yummy cinnamon pastry.  Next came super fresh fruit.  I picked huevos rancheros with chicken chili.  This was a nice break from the ordinary.

What is also curious is the place is always packed, maybe its the same people always going just wearing different clothes or maybe my mind was waning.  The first time i went the Tex Mex rolls were recommended.  I have never tried such a concept so i gave it a whirl.  It wasn't the greatest appetizer ever but it was something different and worth the gamble as i left other desiring appetizers in my hand.   For entree, the fillet and the crab cakes were both winners.   On the dark side i wasn't crazy about the wasabi mashed potatoes.   Now I am a big fan of wasabi and mashed potatoes and was eager to try them, but was overwhelmed by the root.   Not sure why chefs try to mess with mashed potatoes so much, just like hamburger helper they do just fine by themselves.   Here are more reasons to grab an arm and head out for a moondance, BYOB, everything is made fresh to order, chef comes out often to check on customers, and they have prefix menu specials during the week.

You were right, my friend.Dinky as a daisy and blue as a cornflower, I can criticise this little joy in one way only - that it isn't nearer to my house. Their ""soup and half sandwich"" deal for £4.95 is pretty breath-taking - if that's HALF a sandwich, I don't wanna see a full one! You can choose the bread type for your butty as well - I went with a tiger baguette filled with chilli chicken mayo and yippity-yum was I glad that I did. Good hearty soup to go with it, too, oh yes indeedy. That, along with a generous pot of tea, hit the spot for £7.15, which I reckon is pretty darned good going.They also, as Blythe and Julie both mentioned, do Tennessee buttermilk pancakes (ZZZZZIP) so I will be back ere long to have a chompy brekkist here as well.The menu is presented on a clipboard and the wall is adorned with the simple but rather effective conceit of spelling the name of the cafe in large letters, each printed on A4, popped on a clipboard and stuck to the wall. The only other piece of decoration on the wall is an adorable poster for the cafe's Tennessee namesake, the famous acoustic music club.Disclosure: I have never been the kind of person who has a yen to travel. Tennessee, however, is one of the only places in the world I have ever actually wanted to go to. And now I feel like I can trot on down there for pancakes any day of the week."

Having not really sampled pulled jackfruit before (maybe once at a potluck) and the only place I knew of offering it was one of Glasgow's vegan places,  I was keen to try it. I'm not really sure what the texture is meant to be like -  soft or chewy. I had it with jalapenos, avocado,  and vegan cheese (Violife) on a bed of nachos,  so I just scooped it all up and inhaled. It wasn't chewy,  but having not eaten pork for over 20 years,  a replacement wasn't really something I was looking out for. Is pulled pork chewy? I have no idea. It was delicious anyway. Service was great and the server said they're looking at making some changes to the menu - which may include vegan pancakes. Will be looking out to see if that options makes the cut!  You can sit in or takeaway.

The atmosphere is cozy and relaxed. They were one of the only spots opened on a Sunday morning at 8am, and that was a blessing. This was also my first time visiting Scotland so I wanted to get a good Scottish breakfast. I got my wife and I two large cappuccino's that were delicious, a breakfast sandwich with a fried egg, bacon, and haggis, and fresh baked cheddar croissant . The breakfast roll was light and fluffy, and very tasty. The fried egg was cooked perfect with the egg yolk runny and bacon was crispy, but not burnt. My wife's cheddar fresh morning baked croissant was very tasty with a nice sharp cheddar taste all the way through. Perfect way to start a Sunday morning!

Based on the original cafe in Memphis, it has a southern cooking influenced menu. Everything is house made from the scones, soups and delicious meatloaf. Rory and Fergus gave us their best Scottish hospitality while we dined, luggage in tow, whilst waiting to check in our Air BnB flat directly above. My husband enjoyed the pancakes, I was lucky to have a taste, and I have to say they might have been the best pancakes I have personally ever tasted. I had a freshly baked scone cinnamon walnut scone and a delicious Americana. I went down later to take out the meatloaf sandwich and it was wonderful.Thank you to Rory & Fergus for making our morning comfortable and delicious!

I sampled very good soup, from a daily selection of four varieties, and quite a good hotdog. Their breakfast menu looks intriguing, with Tennessee buttermilk pancakes on offer. It might be a good spot for a Yelpy brunch visit, but given it's rather small there'd only be room for around ten people, I reckon.Overall, we said: ""the Bluebird Cafe looks to be starting from a very promising position. They have some kinks to iron out, and some menu typos to correct, but I think they have a strong chance of developing into a real local favourite. It's a place that's well worthy of a visit, I'd say."""

I first heard about it several years ago when I was in a pizza place down the road that had great cookies. I asked if they baked them on site and they said they got them from a bakery just north of Mayfield on Chillicothe. A few weeks later I found it and loved the cookies but also saw that they made much more including traditional Italian baked goods.I returned today as I was in the area and stocked up on a few more treats sfingi, cream cheese nut horns, cuccidati filled with figs and dates, and almond and coconut torringini. The owner/baker, Sal, is a fifth generation and the family has been in business since 1893. Sal told me he uses 40% peanut butter in his peanut butter cookies. Katie was behind the counter and was extremely knowledgeable, friendly and helpful.Check it out, good stuff.

Usually it is pretty quick even though there are lines in the drive-thru as usual.I decided to Yelp this place today though because it is either extreme coincidence or racism that occurs each time I go. I honestly don't care either way, but I think it is interesting to report..I am a Caucasian adult male, and I commonly have African American adult males ringing me up or handing me the GIANT bag for the one order of french fries. Every single time so far they avoid looking at me, don't ask me if I need anything or any questions, and beyond that they literally do not say a WORD. Even when I say 'thank you' before I leave it is ignored.Today though, which is also why I wanted to write a review, FOR THE FIRST TIME, I was asked if I wanted ketchup, and my fiance didn't want any, but I was glad that someone thought about how they never give you anything, not even salt, on the side, and wanted to make sure the order was okay. The funniest joke about this was that he was an older Caucasian adult male. He even responded when I said 'thank you'. That is what made the difference of treatment stand out to me. I always assume fast food workers won't say a word, but this particular experience painted a weird picture over the different visits.I wish I would have asked his name. I think people deserve credit for doing things like that, it is exhausting to have to keep that energy with every customer all day.

I don't eat @ McDonald's or other fast food establishments.  Usually if I did, it's because i was being cute using their free coupons or special promos (birthdays, anniversaries,...).Yesterday around 1 PM, I decided to stop by since I was in the neighborhood to redeem their free coupons that I received in the (junk) mail, for free small fries and a fruit smoothie.  I selected strawberry-flavored smoothie for a 'drink' to wash down the fries.  I was served by cashier Daniel, who was very polite and timely, and he even thought it was cute that I had the free coupons ;)  He accepted 2 separate coupons, and I was not charged sales tax so I didn't have to pull change out of my wallet.  How courteous.  I dined in, partly so I could take a photo in that setting for you Yelpers ;)  I sat at a cool polished 'wood' counter with a comfy leather stool, cozily inside the one area that looked like it's for WifFi users (not sure if you could use a laptop at that very area as I didn't bring mine). The fries were hot and tasty with not too much salt, and the smoothie had the right texture and wasn't too much like softened ice cream and wasn't too cold and did taste like strawberry.  Oh, when I asked another server next to Daniel if there was a fork, she handed me fork & knife that were encased in factory-sealed plastic wrap.  She also hinted that there were a straw and self-service ketchup at a station behind me.  It was just fairly busy and the staff kept up with that pace as if they were properly trained for their positions.  Even the rest of the people picking up or dining in were polite.  As I was waiting for my order (for about 5 minutes, a woman came up to Daniel and mentioned something wrong with her hamburger (like missing the onions), he quickly accompanied her without treating her like an anal hassle.  I also noticed that the establishment appeared to have been renovated, and it was clean and very modern, and the ambiance was casual and room temperature was at a comfortable level..Overall, it was a professional service for that type of establishment, and I left pleased.  It must've been a good day due to very cool weather :)

It's a place to have a big breakfast and watch some of the interesting people that you now are regulars among others. It's always clean and the service pretty quick. it's by no means and exciting venue!   is okay for what it is.  I am not a big breakfast eater so it serves the purpose when I am in that particular mood.When I am traveling I often go to a MacDonald's for breakfast.  I usually need to eat something and can count on pretty standard fare and a decent price.  If it's just before catching a plane in the morning, a Greek meal that I might prefer first thing in the morning might not set well at takeoff as a big breakfast..

I saw all of the past reviews and understood the reason for the low ratings.  My family and I were at the Verizon Wireless across the other side of the large parking lot; after 3+ hours of waiting in there, and we were STARVING.  Right across from this location is a Chic-Fil-A that we love but their parking area was full and the drive-thru line was long.  We saw this huge sign on this McDonald's ""Grand Opening"" and there were no more than two cars parked in their parking.  I remember reading the reviews but I knew the kids were starving and we all needed to use the restrooms as well.  So we crossed our fingers.... I don't know what it was, maybe it's because they felt changed, upgraded, or new but the staff was amazing!  Every single person actually seemed happy to be there.  They greeted us, took our order and we were handed over a pager.  (Guess it's better than yelling your name)  The restrooms were locked so when I asked for the ""key"" they pushed a button from the side wall and was advised it was unlocked and I could go ahead.  The ladies restroom was small but very clean.  Unfortunately, no paper towels to dry my hands with and so I had to grab the handle to open the door.  The entire place was clean.  The soda fountain/ketchup area was very clean and in order.  Not a single dirty table or food anywhere on the floor.  The place is divided in half... the area with more tables and open seats (quiet area) and then the play area with more space between tables for parents/families.  They had comfortable chairs for the wheelchair accessible tables too.   If you've been here before... give it another chance.  Yes, it's just fast-food.  There WILL be children but if you dine-in, there's plenty of comfortable seats away from the playground area.  We noticed that they had a lot of young children BY-THEMSELVES with no parents and no supervision around.  There was also a few homeless guests that stopped in but they were taken care of the same and they weren't bothering anyone.  I have nothing negative to say about this McDonald's.  We were hungry and our food looked and tasted good.  No soggy fries or over fried nuggets that have been sitting in old cooking oil - none of that.  As I was taking pictures to share on Yelp... (I was spotted with my phone - lol)  a manager came up to me concerned, asking me if something was wrong.  I advised him that everything was fine.  He was actively involved assisting in the drive-thru as he was with the front registers."

This is the cleanest/safest McDonald's in the area and I never hesitate to stay here to do work if I'm feeling too cheap to hit up Starbucks. I've encountered the occasional weirdo, but I don't feel too bad when a non-weirdo is sitting on the other side of me. There are also TVs that usually play CNN or FOX (not sure).

I feel a bit silly reviewing a McDonalds, but you have to give credit where it's due.  The five stars goes to the morning crew.  There have been many mornings where i have been hungry on the way to work, so i succumb to the temptation of the golden arches.I used to be intimidated if there are four or five cars in line.  Not at this place.  And not only are they SUPER fast, it's ALWAYS fresh and delicious.  I'll often pick up egg and cheese mcmuffins for some of my coworkers and we all agree.  They must have magic elves in the kitchen because these are the best mcmuffins e.v.e.r.  I also think they must have some sort of mind control device that causes your time to speed up while their time slows down, because on more than one occasion, I've barely had to stop my car because there they are, window open, beverage and bag in hand, smile and ""have a nice day"" on their lips.

Coffee is good enough, although the pastries were definitely nothing special - my indicators were a croissant (not flakey) and a scone (kinda dry). Also, they're kinda slow in the morning if you're grabbing something on the way to the bus, despite there being no line -- their employees might want to drink some more coffee in the am =)But if you want to get some work done and you've got a laptop, it's great - nice big place and employees who could care less if you're hanging out. In this respect, the only downside is that it's kinda dark inside - lots of grey decor for some reason, but hey, that makes me feel like I'm in the office or something. Plus, they have real chairs, which makes it more comfortable to hang out. All in all, if I want a cup of ""the best"" coffee and/or an awesome pastry, I'd go somewhere else, but space-wise, this is a much better space to study or do some work. Wifi too I think, but haven't tested it myself.(Oh, but -2 for the company's stupid, slow to load flash website.)"

Each is a fine, fine, soft, chewy confection that will turn heads and invite stares. It's the pastry as conversation piece. Ingenious.""Where'd you get dat big ass cookie, man?""It always feels a little weird when I walk in here, however, as if I'm a vagrant that stumbled into a library. Aside from hearing WYEP or NPR on the radio, it's shockingly quiet. None of the customers smile. It appears that they're all trying to impress each other with what they're...reading?

I chatted with one barista for like 10 minutes on and off about random sh** while making sure not to disrupt other customers and orders flows. They are friendly and they brew fresh coffee. I'm not concerned about the food options here. This is a coffee shop and they use a good roast, medium and dark. I like their dark Colombian roast. All were nice.

Does that make sense? They won't chit chat at all, and they never have a smile on their faces. That's fine, they make my coffee quick. My biggest issue is the actual coffee. I always get a mocha, and I understand there is a fair amount of sugar in it, but it is always so damn sweet!! Actually hurts my teeth. Sometimes, maybe once a month, they get it pretty close. But most of the time, you can't even taste the coffee, just a mouthful of sweet. Gah!!! And the temperature is always lukewarm. NEVER hot enough. I have business downtown 3 times a week, so I try to hit Starbucks there when I can. Often, I just don't have the time and have to hit Crazy Mocha once I make it back to the 'hood.

People are very nice and even though everyone might be in line for more than an hour, the wait is very tolerable.  Ice cold beer and Bloody Mary's mixed with loud, happy conversation actually makes it fun.Bottom line - my husband has dialysis every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday evenings. We try at least once a month to get his Friday switched to Saturday, simply for this fish fry.

I have been going to this place for about one year.  The first time we went later around 9 pm or so and a lot of the fish was gone.  I had an amazing hamburger instead, meat from Jenifer St Market. Besides the first time, I have always gotten the fish.  The perch is amazing and be sure to get the loaded baked potato.  The craft beer selection is impressive.  Chico-the owner is usually cooking, it's a small kitchen, so be prepared to wait, but it's worth it. My fiance usually gets the walleye and loves it. It's now my go to place for fish!

Low key, no frills, tasty food and a wide variety of beers.  Jukebox with a little bit of everything and pool tables.  If you want to be sociable, you can sit around the bar, or if you want to hide out from society (as I often do) you can sit in the backroom and drink.Food was good, but, again, no frills.  Burgers come with chips on the side if you don't order an appetizer of fries.  I heard a few customers raving about the fish fry and it seemed to be quite popular.  We got there at around 8:00 and dinner was winding down.Cheap, too.  About $60 for two burgers, eleven beers and a shot.  Don't ask me why I thought it'd be a good idea for my date and I to drink that much alcohol, but luckily Villa Tap is close enough to walk to...

However, it does make for a good option for food if you have sometime before a flight (given the proximity to the airport)Parking is limited to about ~15 cars so if you get street parking around, grab it.

We haven't tried the fish fry yet, but it's on the to-do list. We actually went there for Valentine's Day - wanted to avoid the crowds, in the mood for a good cheeseburger, etc - had a great time. The burgers were top-notch, jukebox is great (they have a weird abundance of live Dead, which is great). The regular customers are nice and friendly also - it's not an intimidating ""townie-bar"" (hello, Tip Top!) but the regulars are SO nice and fun to talk to. Owner Chico is really nice, and we love that he's going out of his way to buy local ingredients and beer. He's got House of Brews on tap even!

Neighborhood place without a lot of ""Jukebox Stopping"" when you walk in (you know, where you walk in and the record on the jukebox screetches to a halt and everyone stares at you.) Came in this Tuesday. Barkeep very friendly (as usual) told me of the Gyro special and the soup, but sadly, the fryer was D.O.A. NO FRIES. Well, ,ok by me, burger's the name of my game. Got the Bacon Cheese with Cheddar and the Greenage (Lettuce tomato), make the onions fried. Burger came hot and sassy. Can't complain about the taste, good as always, but the bun is another matter. Tasty, but it just couldn't stand up to the grease from the meat and the onslaught of fried onions and the juice of tomato. I would recommend it, especially for the cost, but if you go with a burger at the villa tap, skip the greenage and get your onions raw."

The Villa Tap is pretty small - I love going in on a Friday night just to see how a kitchen that small (it takes up a small portion of space behind the bar) puts out so much food consistently well.  Always worth the wait. The staff is super; always smiling, joking, and happy to fill your glass!  I also had a tasty Bloody Mary my last visit.

It goes from 530PM until 930... but I'd strongly suggest getting in there by 9. My friend had the perch, which was kind of chewy and too salty. The potato he got was a bit tough, too. I had the walleye and a side of fries- it was a whole different experience. The piece was huge (see pic), and the fish was just delicious. Really, perfect. They also offer cod and a jumbo shrimp dish, neither of which I've tried yet. All come with slaw, rolls and butter. Service was good, and they do have malt vinegar if you want it (I felt sheepish because I brought my own just in case...). So, get the walleye, not the perch. And play the jukebox.

The Villa Tap neighborhood bar looks as it hasn't changed in forty years. The wooden bar is topped with a baseball cards that have a laminate over them.Want to drink? Stop over. They have friendly bartenders and great prices. The bartenders do a nice job on the bloodies and Old Fashioneds.Want to eat? Om nom. They have some type of food every night, but their Friday fish fry is worth going. The perch or walleye is what you should get. Even though it was busy when we were there, the servers were funny, had a good attitude, and our food came promptly. They know what the hell they are doing.

I had the shrimp which was HUGE and done perfectly. My partner had the cod and it was also done perfectly.  Very light (homemade) batter, and the cod was moist and delish!

Chico does it right people, so go visit this place! Yum!

I haven't been to the Villa Tap in years. The place hasn't changed a bit.  Great neighbor hood bar.

We split the walleye and the perch - both were excellent, and worthy of 5 stars on their own. Washed it down with a good Old Fashioned. The only knock I have is that the sides - coleslaw, rolls, fries, and loaded potato - were just average. Otherwise, this was a great find and worth the trip over from the west side!One piece of advice: We got there on Friday at 5:15 and it took about 30 minutes for our food to come out. The table next to us had people sit down at about 6:00, and they were told it would take an hour for their food to come out, so get there early!!

Were able to get the last order of cod they had, so went with one cod and one walleye. The cod was done really well, walleye was above average but not the best in Madison. The owner was behind the bar frying the fish. Was awesome getting to see him in action, hand breading every piece and frying it up to a perfect golden brown. If you love fish at a dive bar, this is your place. IF you are looking for more of an ambiance, go elsewhere. Good, solid food with no frills.

Sent it back, second one came back well done.  Choked it down.  Will go back for the fish fry, no other night.

I am giving this place 5 stars because it is wonderful for a very simple meal, with excellent service.  We had a little trouble finding the door (the entrance is in the back facing away from Packers Ave.) but once we walked in and sat at one of their wobbly tables, we were instantly greeted by our friendly server.  Though the bar was busy, we got our drinks immediately, along with a basket with two basic white bread rolls and coleslaw.  All very standard issue.  The fish was another story. Whoa.  I got the Canadian perch and my boyfriend got the Canadian walleye.  The large single piece of walleye was lightly breaded and fried perfectly.  It was buttery, non-fishy, and totally delicious.  The baked potato that came with it was pretty standard, but good.  The perch was battered differently in a thicker, more crunchy coating.  The little strips were just AMAZING.  I got a pile of 7 or 8 strips that I honestly couldn't stop eating.  The fries were done to perfection as well.  My boyfriend and I are somewhat light eaters in general, but we cleared out all of that fried goodness in one sitting.  On the way out the cooks from the back yelled good bye, the bartender wished us a good night, and someone standing by the door smiled and asked us to come back soon.  I can't say enough about how friendly everyone here is.  It looks like a burned out biker bar, but their simple menu is done right.  I never thought I would like a place so much that doesn't have salad on their menu, but I anticipate we will be back many many more times.

Chico is frequently working and you can tell takes a lot of pride in his work. The food is all great ranging from the cuban pulled pork to the burgers to the chicken fingers and assortment of fry like things. It's bar food but the meat comes from Jenny St. Market so its good quality! The weekend meat raffles are fun. The mixed drinks are great. The bar tenders make it a point to get to know their customers. They also participate in the bar league which offer 'safe rides' if you should happen to enjoy yourself too much to ensure you safely get home.

They're big, the batter is just the right thickness, and the flavor is so good you won't bother with the provided shrimp sauce. The cod is very good too, and I've heard good things about the walleye, but the shrimp is my go-to for good Friday night eating. Get there early though as the wait after six or so can be VERY long.

I plan to come back to try their cheeseburger and the other fried fish. This time around I got cod. The fries were good (thicker cut) but nothing special. Helpful tip: If you want a table, get here early. By the time I rolled in at 5pm, there was no parking left and already a long wait for tables. You can sign up for a table on the whiteboard but be prepared to wait. It's worth it for fish this good!

The atmosphere was laid back, the lighting was just right and the lounge singer was pretty good. I had one of there pizzas which was very good. They use a frozen crust but then add all the toppings to it right there so it was much better than your usual bar type frozen pizza. The beer is excellent and they had a huge selection of wine. The one thing I would change about this place is the service, we had to go to the bar to order everything. They have tables all over the place but no one apparently waiting on them, it was kind of wierd. Maybe we were just unlucky?I will go back again and see if the service is the same or better?-INTERESTING-So after my original post above, I actually read through some of the other reviews and it seems that the lack of service may be the norm for this place. I am not going to change my 4-star ranking as I really enjoyed the atmosphere here..... I hate being at a bar that is so noisy you can't hear the person sitting next to you so for that alone they get a bonus star. I will say that if the service stinks the next time I stop by I will be disappointed.

They always have decent entertainment, never too crowded, great cocktails, and good atmosphere. The Brink is the kind of place where you can always find a cozy spot to sit and you can carry on a conversation.Some of my favorite offerings include specialty martinis for $5, a decent draft beer selection, and some pretty decent pizza. Check out Thursdays for free jazz! The Madison Jazz Orchestra plays there once a month and they're phenomenal.

It has a lounge feeling, perhaps since it's in the lower level of the building.  The food was good, pizza was generously topped and tasty.  The spinach artichoke dip was served in a bread bowl (which was deceptively not hollowed out very well, I might add... making it appear there was a lot more dip than there really was!). What would improve this place would be service.  It wasn't very busy on this Friday night and there were at least four staff members behind the bar, and yet nobody working the floor taking drink orders.  It's nice to be able to sit and listen to the music and chat; I found it a bit of an interruption to have to get up to go to the bar every time you wanted another round. BOTTOM LINE:  I enjoyed the atmosphere, nice lighting and lively music which was not too loud that you couldn't carry on a conversation.  If they'd add a server or two it'd be even better!

If you go when there's no special event hosted by a company, it's practically empty. The Brink can be nice when you are looking for something more relaxed because there are fewer customers than at a traditional bar or lounge.  It is true that you can easily find adequate seating for yourself and a group, but the Brink can feel like it lacks anything else but the star attraction of that night (a band, fundraising event, dance gathering, etc).

We catered food from somewhere else, (they let you bring in any caterer you want) but The Brink staff was very helpful and laid back in what we could do. I kept thinking ""this is way too easy, something is not getting done"", but everything was perfect the night of. They had the tables set up, said I could come in and do whatever decorating I wanted beforehand, then they had a staff member checking in with us the rest of the evening. She was helpful but not intrusive. Everyone had a great time and loved the venue. The only negative is the parking, it is a tiny lot, but there is lots of street parking. Since our event started at 5:30 it was not a problem, but probably later in the evening it is busier. Thanks to Matt and his staff for a great night!"

Yes, when you walk in, you feel like it's a hotel lobby.  That said, it's still pretty chill and laid back, clean and pleasant.  All the bartenders were younger girls.  They were attentive and nice.  My boyfriend had a beer on tap, I had a cosmopolitan.  The cosmo was very tart, but those are hit or miss everywhere you go.  Ordered the spinach dip.  It was good, but you don't get much. Their pizza looked great! We will probably try that if/when we go back. I don't think there were actual servers, people kept going to the bar to order.  Which was kind of bothersome having people file up to the bar right next to us the whole time.There was a band setting up, looks like they charge covers for bands, we left before they started, though.  Not a bad place, glad we stopped here.

Locally born musician Paul Kowert with his current  project, trio Haas Kowert Tice.  Amazing!  Phenomenal musicians and a wonderful sound.The lounge itself is a great place too.

It is in a basement of a building under High Noon and Brass Ring. The decoration and the spacing of furniture reminded me of a hotel lobby ... a 3 stars hotel lobby. My friend and I sat down at the bar, and it took a while for one of two bartenders to serve us on the totally empty Wednesday night. Well, they were very nice, but lacking in attentiveness. The wine list deserves commendable praise, but their Mint Julep missed the mark with a wide margin.Like Oski t says, it's a nice place, I can't really rave about it. Maybe the place is uncharacteristically large for a Madison bar, and too clean.

We were there later in the evening on a Thursday. There was a 5 man jazz combo and some sort of open mic thing going on.  Seriously, a guy played violin with the jazz combo, I'd never seen that before. We did not eat anything but staff seemed great.  My only complaint, I wish the music had gone a little later in the night, I think it stopped at 11pm (Thurs night).  We are from out of town, we found this place in a Madison Nightlife magazine in our hotel.  The staff at the hotel also recommended it when we asked where live music would be playing.  We took the hotel shuttle there and cab ride back was only $5 so parking was not an issue for us.

Definitely in my top 3. Since I'm allergic to vodka, they made the chocolate martini with a different liquor. I can't remember which one and it was so strong, I think I almost passed out in my seat. They definitely don't skimp on the liquor. Great way to top off my bachelorette night!

We weren't planning on staying to eat but it became too late to go anywhere else. The pizza was fine. A little too cheesy for my taste. The previous reviews about the strange decor were right on. It is like a bad hotel bar down there. The space has SO much potential but it is not being utilized. I don't think I would go back but am glad I tried it.

It is very DIY -- need to find your own caterer, cake, do all the decorating yourself -- but if you're bored with windowless ballrooms and grey wedding food, it may be the place for you. The venue has 3 stories that are all at your disposal and plenty of other rooms plus an outdoor patio for people to hang out as the night goes on. The best feature is the huge spiral staircase on which you get to make your entrance into the dining room. And Matt Brink is one of the nicest people I have ever worked with. He and his dad own the place, they are very accommodating and happy to help make your wedding day perfect!

Matt Brink the owner was great in helping us out with everything. They don't require a specific cater, thus you can choose any place for it as long as they have a valid license. I would highly recommend anyone who is getting married to check this place out as a venue. I don't think they have increased pricing since then, but at least check it out as there were no other venues that were low cost in the downtown area.

They could have just told me instead of giving me that attitude. And most of the time, the cook guy always stared at me with one eye and kinda threw the takeout box to me when they gave it to me. I honestly love the food here among other places in York Lane but their service is very bad. I revisited sometime only night time when I needed a quick dinner. In general, I would not really want to go here, however."

Fraticelli's is one of my favourite sit down restaurants in Richmond Hill. Their decor, and food is amazing. Although their  service is a bit of a hit or miss everything else about this place is amazing. The complementary bread and olive oil sauce is so good and sometimes I wish i could just eat that as my main. The chicken piccata with basil pesto orzo is amazing!!! This is a fairly generous portion including two chicken breasts and lots of orzo topped with delicious capers. Im not a fan of pasta but I do love me some ravioli and Fraticelli's did not disappoint, my only negative comment would be that the ravioli was a bit too buttery but nonetheless still delicious. Overall im always fairly pleased with this place, and I have yet to sit on their patio :)

The place has a great ambience, style and excellent service.  However, I found the food lacking.  It was my first time there, so I won't fully discount it yet.  But the pizza I had was mostly all dough with very little taste.On a plus note, I overheard the ladies att he table next to us complain about their pasta.  The manager immediately made them a new dish,Great service, but mediocre food.

With my husband I wouldn't go back due to the cost + lack of service but if someone else is paying, SURE! ;) I would recommend the butternut squash ravioli which was delicious and the spumoni ice cream. It's a clown-coloured slice of ice cream that is super fruity, very kid like but apparently is a traditional Italian dessert.

The service is always great. I come here at least once a month. Literally the place my family goes to and last minute date plans with my boyfriend. For the starters I recommend the sliders, the mussels (my ultimate favourite.. The sauce is HELLA good), calamari fritti and the fondue. My go to is always the chicken Parmesan, the pastas are also pretty good but not all, well not every pasta is everyone's cup of tea. My aunts favourite is there gourmet pizza, especially the one with arugula on top. Every time we go to a different restaurant she always tries to see if they would have it on the menu. I'm giving this a 5 star because they have a good selection of food, great service with the servers always smiling, and the place looks great. It may be a little on the pricey side but it's worth it trust me.

Been here numerous times, and gotta say that I enjoyed it every time!Decided to come here again after a long while, and had a really good meal! First off, the interior design and decor was beautiful. With a modern twist on a classic design, it gave a sense of a true Italian restaurant with modern lighting! There was jazz music playing in the background as well, which is always a plus in my books. Everybody loves some Franky!One of the amazing things about Fraticelli's is that they have an amazing featured menu. It changes every once in a while, but offers different dishes you don't get to try often. Once I had a mahi mahi that was magical, and last night they had a swordfish (which I didn't order due to the price). The items are typically more expensive, but if you go for it, you definitely won't be disappointed. We decided to go for an Arugula Salad, the Penne alla Vodka, and the Meatballs al Forno to start.The meatballs are homemade, which is always a nice touch, and came with 4 little meatballs in a tomato sauce. The meat itself had a strong herb taste and a little on the tougher side, but paired very well with the tomato sauce and cheese on top!The Arugula Salad my friend got was very generous, with a lot in the bowl, especially the cheese and chickpeas. My friend chose to add in salmon, and it was cooked nicely to a medium.The Penne alla Vodka was really good, with bacon and onion cooked in with a creamier sauce, it was done very well.For dessert, we shared a Chocolate Tartufo, which was really good as well. A nice decadent chocolate covered in cocoa powder made a nice contrast between the sweet and bitter. The service was very good though, with attentive and informative servers, they really understood their menu and was able to give some nice advice and recommendations. Would definitely consider coming her a little more in the future, as it has been a while!

THere is only just enough sauce to prevent the pizza from being dry; lobster pieces are few and far between, tiny when you do come across 'em. Crust is salted, a little bit too much so, but a little salt did make eating pizza bones enjoyable.appetizers all sounded pretty tasty; settled on the FONDUTA FRATICELLI -- a 5-cheese dip with pita, bread, and polenta cakes. This most definitely is one of those all-beige-meals-that-is-pretty-tasty-but-you-know-you-shouldn't-be-eating. Polenta cakes were fried fingers of polenta and really satisfying on their own. bread was fresh. dip best enjoyed warm -- i.e. before it cools and congeals. Garnished on top were wo cherry tomatoes to trick you into thinking that the dish is remotely healthy.more free bread on the side rounded out our carbo-loading adventure. it's so flipping hard to turn down fresh bread. so. hard.

I really liked the texture of the stringy hand made spaghetti.  It was like comfort food and very al dente!  I also liked the double smoked bacon slices within the spaghetti.  I wish there were more egg and caramelized onions in the dish though and even more cheese would have made the dish come together more in terms of flavour.  When comparing this pasta dish to the one that we all had here on our first visit (a creamy fettuccine seafood dish that was on special that night), this one pales in comparison.  Nevertheless, I still really enjoyed the quality of the pasta here! :)

We ordered the antipasti as an appetizer and I ordered the Tuscan Burger with house salad.  The salad was a little drenched in a pool of oil with some balsamic.  The Antipasti was good.  Tuscan burger was amazing. I thought the service was a little to be desired.  Reason being is that we had to ask for drink refills.  Also when I was looking to leave I had to take the bill up as our server was busy chatting it up with another table.  Maybe I'm just being picky but we were in a rush to leave!  For the price I expect a bit better service!

I came here twice so far within the last 6 months and both time I had a wonderful good time at Fraticelli's.  The server that was serving us did say they had new management around more than half a year ago, so maybe the foods are a lot better than previously.The decoration in this restaurant is nice, although I have to say it was a little dim, but it didn't bother me that much.  My most recent visit is when they were having a special lobster menu and they were very appealing.  For a dinner for three, we ordered the following items:Calamari Alla Griglia - appetizerLobster Bisque - appetizer (soup)Caesar Salad - appetizerAmericana Pizza - Main (Pizza)Chicken Alfredo Fettuccine - Main (Pasta)Pappardelle Alla Bolongnese - Main (Pasta)That is quite a lot of food for 3 people! Out of all the food above, I was most impressed with the Grilled Calamari (Calamari Alla Griglia), Lobster Bisque and the Bolongnese.  The salad is average, but the pizza, I thought it was very dry and I prefer the Pizza Hut style pizzas!The calamari was displayed very nicely and with the sour sauce on top, it created a good chemistry.The Lobster BIsque had very strong lobster flavour which was fantastic for a lobster bisque lover like me.The Bolongnese sauce was great, the server did recommend us to add Meatballs on top and I did, but I thought the meatballs were not that good and if I can redo this, I would prefer eating the pasta by itself.  The texture of the pasta was normal, definitely not as al-dente as the bigger name Italian restaurants in downtown such as Terroni (I wrote a review for Terroni too!)  To end the night, we wrapped up with a Latte.  The latte was great, but I was hoping a little bit of latte art on top. Overall, I would give this play a 4 for offering solid environment, appetizers and pastas!

The meal starts with complementary bread and dipping sauce...absolutely incredible. I could've just had that for dinner. For appetizers we got the specials they were offering- one was crab cakes, which were crumbly, tasteless, and over-all mediocre. The other was toasted bread slices, goat cheese, and cranberry relish. Basic, simple, but very, very good.For the entree I got the spaghetti del pescatore. Nice sauce, generous amounts of mussles and calamari (although only 3 shrimp), and the pasta itself was cooked perfectly. The only other entree I tried was my younger sister's spaghetti and meatballs ordered off the kid's menu- this, surprisingly, was also quite good...had a real 'homemade' taste to it.For desert I ordered a chocolate amaretto creme brulee. This was truly a masterpiece, one of the best deserts I've had. Thin, crispy top layer, and creamy rich wonderfully flavoured custard.Service was great as well. Friendly, courteous, and prompt. I easily go through 5 or more drinks through a meal and this is one of the few places where I never found myself waiting for a refill.

I ordered the mushroom risotto and thought it was tasty. The portion was quite decent and I ended up eating the whole thing (don't skip lunch what a bad idea). Was so full afterwards! My bff ordered the same thing but thought hers was too salty. My hubby ordered the pizza but I think they put too little cheese. He had asked for extra cheese... imagine if he hadn't. I would recommend this place if you have a large party. It's great going to places like these w/o having to travel all the way DT or midtown. Not sure if it's offered for a limited time? But if you let them know you're a first time customer, they might offer a complimentary appetizer. When we got the bill, they had a feedback survey for us to complete online & you can also get a free appetizer at your next visit. But remember not to fill it out until you're actually going cuz it expires in 2-3 weeks.Lots of parking.

However, it is much more upscale and fancy, looks very nice and is a pretty good dinner date location. Service was attentive.The food was good on both my visits. Desserts were delish too. Not sure about the authentic-ness of the Italian food served, but I do know it was yummy.Unless it was outstanding, I usually wouldnt give chain restaurants 5 stars. Would come back when craving italian nearby and wanting a fancier atmosphere for special-er occasions.

We ordered two glasses of wine, bruschetta appetizer, lasagna and Butternut squash raviolli and flourless chocolate cake.  I felt the ambience was nice the food was perfect and I will return with my friends next week!

Although I asked for a medium rare steak and it came through as a medium. Still an outstanding meal. Would have been 5 stars if not for the steak prep. I would highly recommend this place.

Pretty happening spot with great live music. On Thursday there were some bar discounts available.  Will be coming again.Servers were awesome too!
