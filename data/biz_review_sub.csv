I had a really bad experience with my childhood dentist. This made it so when I was an adult I didn't go as often and I should have. I moved to Ahwatukee 9 years ago and a friend recommended this office to me.  I've been going regulalry for routine cleaning since. I went last month for a cleaning and found out I needed a crown. Sensing my anxiety he assured me I would be fine. I scheduled my appt. for today. I went in so nervous I wanted to leave.  He came in, explaining everything he would be doing.  He put me at ease and I've never felt better. I would highly recommend Dr. Kode to anyone looking for a dentist. He's restored my faith in dentists. I will go back in a few weeks for the permanent crown and I'm not a bit nervous about it. Thank you so much for your patience with me and the absolute best experience I've had from a dentist."

My husband and I went as we were not happy with our current dentsit.  What a blessing!  We both went and they worked on both of us and did our work that we needed that day!  My husband needed a veneer/crown with no scheduling down the road because of finances. I had priced the crown and the out of pocket cost and this office was 1/2 of what I was quoted from many different offices in the area.   We have great dental insurance which has never been an issue but they were concerned about us and not $$$$$.  I appreciate that.  Everyone in the office was super nice.  I went into the office the next day to get 3 fillings and everyone came by to ask how my husband was and how he liked his work.  I don't know about anyone else but I will pay extra for great customer service.  Here you get the most caring staff and you can understand why when you meet the dentist, Dentist Kobe.

I love the fact that they will call you to schedule an appointment when they have cancellations that might work for you.  Off the top of my head, I can't recall that lady's name that calls from the office all the time, but I just heart her!  She is such a gem.  

I've been to dental offices that are far more technologically advanced with headphones, satellite TV, computer applications that the staff uses to show and explain what's going on with your teeth.  Since I'm an engineer, I love gadgets and tech stuff.  
 
In addition, the main reason I did not give this place a four is the fact that I have to ask ""what is that instrument used to detect?"", ""what does that tell us?"",  ""what does that mean?"".  I absolutely detest going to an office where I'm paying you to do work for me and I leave there not understanding what you did for me.  So, every time I""ve been to this office, I ask those questions.  I don't like it.  the information should flow freely.  It helps when your patient is informed and can make better decisions.

They lied to me and said I had multiple cavities which I don't according to the dentist I go to now. They had a really nice office and equipment but I wasn't going to pay that for them.

I would pay daily for what the insurance didn't cover. They called the insurance everyday and told me what it would cost for the work that day which I paid in full everyday. The final day I paid them and made sure I owed them nothing and they said I'm all paid up. Then months later they claim I owe them over $300 and after talking to the insurance company they claimed the dentist got a quote on one thing but charged them for something different. Well how is that my fault they knew i was not going to be able to pay a bill later yet they screwed up and charged me for it and now they are giving me bad credit over something that I had no control over. Now had the lady at the desk who called my insurance know what to ask the insurance company I would have gladly paid what I needed to that day. You do not dock the customers for your screw ups and that is not how a business keeps customers. I would recommend looking else where unless you too want to be billed for their incompetence. There are plenty of dentists that will not try to pull the wool over your eyes. Tell you one thing but mean another.

Perhaps due to some of the abnormal experiences I had gone through up until now. Not having insurance or being covered by my parents plan. As a result of growing up close to the boarder I often made trips to Mexico for my dentistry work.

My friend who works there suggested I'd come in for a cleaning and after a few months of reluctancy I finally decided to make an appointment. In all honestly I was visibly uncomfortable which was largely due to the lapse of time between visits.

However, Dental By Design made every effort to make me feel as calm and comfortable as possible. The office itself is very clean, the front line were all amazingly nice, pleasant and helpful. They worked with my budget because at the time I was uninsured and I was able to fit into a payment plan that worked best for me.

I'm not sure if bed side manner is a term associated with dentistry but Dr. Curry handled me with care. She spoke me all the through my assessment and made sure I understood her, outlining steps to make moving forward.

I can't say I'll look forward to the dentist again, but I will say I look forward to being in a welcoming, knowledgeable, and safe atmosphere again with individuals who do great work."

When I first moved to the Phoenix area, I probably tried out about 8 different dentists before finally listening to my co-worker's referral and coming here. Dr. Kode is an awesome dentist. He is highly skilled, and uses up-to-date high tech equipment. Marianne is also the best dental hygienists that I have had. She is thorough, gentle, and very knowledgeable about everything!!! She is also a perfectionist, which I can appreciate-being one myself, and never misses anything. Sheryl, Sandy, and Heather are also fantastic, and always friendly! I don't know the rest of the staff as well, but everyone has always been overly nice. 

In addition to being extremely competent, this dental office is also very patient-oriented. They have events (like movie nights) for patients, and always have really cool giveaways. They are also involved in community events and charity work. 

Moreover, they are also very compassionate and considerate of patients who do not have dental insurance. They are very reasonably priced, which is rare for this quality of service. 

I moved to California for school almost 2 years ago, but I am still driving to Arizona twice a year just to see these guys! They are totally worth it! I tried out a dentist in California who charged me twice as much for a cleaning and did a horrible job. Being in graduate school, I don't have time or money for trial-and-error dentists, and it's good to know that this office is there for me, even though I have to drive about 350 miles to get there. :)

Thank you!!!"

His staff from the front desk (shout out to Sandy) to the everyone behind the scenes like his best hygienist, MaryAnn take care of our family like we're one of their own. Face it, no one likes going to the dentist. But Dental by Design has made the experience a pleasant one.

I then had my hair washed and sat down for him to cut my hair.  He prepared to make his first cut and had quite a bit of length in his hand.  I asked him if that is what he planned on cutting off and he said yes.  I reminded him that I wanted a trim only and wanted to keep my length.  He then proceeded to tell me he was not going to cut my hair because I would not let him have space to be creative.  He said ""I'll dry your hair for you though.""  Really? How nice of him.

It's like they hadn't known for months we were coming on that particular Saturday morning to get our hair done. It was so rushed and chaotic that none of us, including the bride, enjoyed the experience. 

I had even helped them a great deal by straightening my hair beforehand. My hair is really curly and I figured it would be easier to manage and style if I straightened it. I did warn them that I straightened it and not to put any water on it b/c the curls would spring up like perennials in Spring. Now to their credit, the woman who was styling my hair didn't put any water on it, but she was using hairspray and a curling iron (which I told her may not be necessary) and she made a comment, ""wow you weren't kidding when you said your hair was curly"". b/c as she was spraying the hairspray on the ""death by fumes"" setting and curling the hair (fire hazard anyone?) my hair was holding on to the curls made by the curling iron with such intensity that the hair spray wasn't even needed. Umm, did I stutter when I said that my hair is very curly. 

Perhaps I'm being too hard on them, but I had so wanted and expected it to be a good experience (not even great) and I was so disappointed. They didn't do anything that I couldn't have managed on my own with a curling iron and a large can of Aquanet and a few bobby pins."

They did and he told me to allow 2 days to come in and get them so they could get them unloaded from the freigh truck.  I came in yesterday asked about them and they went to the back and got them for me with a smile.  The shoes fit great and were very breathable which is a plus in Phoenix especially this time of year.  I also found a red pair of underarmour shorts and asked at checkout if I could use both of my 20% off coupons as both items were not at Camelback store and they said yes.

I live fairly close to Brick House and typically dine here at least a few times a month. I have been here on dates, with large groups, with clients and with friends. I always enjoy what I order and out of all of my visits I have never, ever had a bad meal or inadequate service. In fact it has always been quite the opposite. The servers have always been attentive and the general manager nearly always stops by to make sure everything is satisfactory. On my most recent visit I had a longer than normal conversation with him and he seems like he is a genuinely nice guy who takes pride in his restaurant and truly cares about the experience his patrons receive.

I have only been going to Brick House for a couple of years and am always surprised when I mention it to people and they think it is another ""breastaurant,"" akin to Hooters or Tilted Kilt. At least for the couple years I have been going, this is no longer the case. The servers all wear shirts that are not overly low-cut and that go all the way down to their pants without a bare midriff. I do think the servers are collectively younger than than a lot of restaurants but they have always been friendly, show enthusiasm for the menu and do a great job!

The décor of Brick House Tavern + Tap is very unique. They have many normal booths and tables but also have a few tables with couches as the seats on either side. They have a few large recliners with table inserts that you can sit at that are positioned in front of large TVs. There are easily 50 TVs around the whole dining area that are positioned in a way where you can see many different ones from wherever you sit. However it also seems that they are not too intrusive and allow one to easily ignore them and focus on who they are dining with. In the winter I often try to get a table near their large open fireplace in the center of the dining room! They also have a large patio with multiple TVs and fireplaces on it.

I think their food is pretty unique as well. They have some really good appetizers that are plenty large enough to share. Their dinner portions provide plenty of food to where I often find myself bringing part of it home with me. Everything seems to be priced very reasonably too.

If you have yet to try Brick House Tavern + Tap I recommend that you add it to your list. If you visited back when it was filled with scantily clad servers maybe visit again now to see the differences. Overall I think it is a fun restaurant with many menu options that should satisfy anyone wanting to eat!"

Brick House is airy and rustic inside with a wood burning fire pit. We came at lunch and it was not busy. All of us opted for iced tea and we had a round on the table within seconds. The house salads were fresh and crispy...honey mustard dressing a bit sweet for my tastes. With just 2/3rds of a glass of iced tea our server asked if we wanted refills...we brushed him off and kept talking. I ordered the blackened mahi sandwich with fries. My colleagues both had the daily special chicken pot pie. As we waited another full round of iced tea arrived. We muttered our acceptances. The mahi was especially juicy and flavorful. In fact I hadn't had such a good piece of fish in this area. The pot pies were flaky and large, nearly 8 inches across with chunks of chicken breast, potatoes and carrots...this was savory goodness. Another round of iced teas arrived and I finally yielded, excusing myself to the restroom. The fries are seasoned well and plentiful...I felt like we got our monies worth for such a decent fish sandwich. As we prepared to pay the check, yet another round of iced teas arrives....this time in to-go cups! Good god man, apparently they need to get rid of this batch of iced tea!! Lol

The atmosphere also gets a 5 star rating.  Where else can you sit on a couch, eat food that is brought to you and watch TV all at the same time?

But here's where it ends for me.  I WILL NOT PATRON A PLACE THAT REQUIRES/LETS THE WAITRESSES WEAR SHORT SHORTS AND TEENY TANKS THAT HIDE NOTHING.  Especially in the dead of winter.  It's gross and disgusting to see things I'm not in the mood to see when I just want to eat.  2nd, being a hetero woman, I'm not really into looking at coochy or boobies.  I'm also NOT into women selling their bodies just for a few more dollars in tips.  I WILL NOT BE RETURNING TO THIS PLACE!!!  If I could give a negative rating, this is the area I would do it in.

Talked about glory days over beer and burgers with a few pals. Calamari and zucchini fried appetizers were crispy and not overly greasy. Enjoyed the jalapeño and cherry peppers accompanying the calamari. Three of four folks got burgers and one person opted for the wild mushroom pizza. We killed two beer bongs of Thirsty Dog Old Leghumper's porter goodness. My burger was tasty but overdone. Medium rare order was cooked well into medium. Tater tots were a great side.

There were some ride and obnoxious people at the bar that took a lot of their attention and a motorcycle gang called ""Switchblade Club"" that occupied the outside area.

They offer brunch on the weekends with two buck mimosas. The variety is great...def a meat based menu which is perfect for my carnivorous boys. I had the duck hash...I just plain heart duck.

The menu looks great. The atmosphere is phenomenal, giving you the option to sit on a patio, at a table, on a couch, in the ""man cave,"" etc... The drink menu is great. The food, however, lacks quality. I ordered a medium rare blue cheese burger with the tater tots, based upon the suggestion of my waitress. After a pretty lengthy wait, the burger came out well-done, and served on a sub bun! It was certainly not the circular wonder-patty, I adore so much. I was willing to move past the rectangular shape of my patty and give it a shot taste-wise, but the beef was just dried out and generally awful. 

That's not to say I would never come back to the Brick House. It seems absolutely worth a try with friends for their drink menu and the atmosphere."

As with the other reviews Brick House is definitely a guys type of place: lots of meat, huge selection of beers, big screen tvs with games, and waitresses dressed in booty hugging shorts. 

I've been here a handful of types mostly with groups after sporting events. If I were a meat eating, beer drinking, sports guy I would give this place 5 stars. However, I am a gluten free vegetarian girl that can eat a salad here. Fun. On the plus side the mixed drinks are pretty generous and delicious. :)"

The atmosphere was really chill and relax. Not only do you have a choice of table, booth but also a couch booth(which we opted for). They have fireplaces going and you're welcomed by the amazing smell of grilled foods. Also they have areas with couches and tv (perfect for you game night folks). 

The service was spectacular and our waitress Savannah was extremely attentive! She was friendly, quick and intuitive to our next need (filling up waters, condiments and etc).

Finally the food was above bar food but not gourmet quality, atleast for my plate. I ordered a bison burger medium rare and I was really disappointed by how over cooked it was. It was pretty much well done, which over all kills the natural flavor. (Pictures attached).
The deviled eggs were amazing but too salty, they sprinkle with sea salt and I would recommend going it and maybe drizzling a little syrup or honey to counter act the saltiness of the bacon in the deviled eggs.
One of us got the duck wings and he was floored by the quality of the sauce and the Sriracha ranch was INCREDIBLE! We had to ask for more of it to dip in and for myself to cover the over cooked texture of the bison. My sister loved her BBQ bacon burger and said it was amazing.

I'm giving it a 4 because I believe maybe my bison was just perhaps an off moment in the kitchen. It's obvious the skill in the cooking from the other plates at our table and the atmosphere makes it all worth the visit."

Today, however, was a whole new level of terrible.

After a few hours of work, I stopped on my way home to grab a late lunch and catch some of the game. The place didn't seem too busy. Plenty of seats on the floor and maybe 6 people at the bar.

As I walked in, 2 hostesses were waiting by the door having a conversation amongst themselves and 1-2 other staff members. 

After a few minutes of standing there...neither addressed me. I shrugged it off and sat myself at one of the 4 sides of the bar in front of one of tv's that had the game I wanted to watch. I had an entire side of the bar to myself. 

A few minutes later, a bartender took my order: a cup of coffee and a breakfast plate with eggs over easy, hash-browns, bacon, and a waffle. Shortly after, when I looked up, I noticed that the channel had been changed to a different game. I waited for her to return to ask if it could be changed back. In the mean time, a cup of coffee was placed in front of me by another person who quickly walked away before I could ask for anything. The tv remained untouched...

I sat and drank the coffee and squinted at another tv across the bar to try to catch some of the game...Finished the coffee and waited a few more minutes before yet another person stopped to ask if I needed anything...I replied ""yes"" and asked about the TV and if I could get another cup of coffee. Her reply was simply, ""sure"". She then quickly turned around and walked away. 

25 minutes later (now well over 45 minutes since I sat down) the person I placed the order with arrives to tell me that my order was mixed up and would be out shortly. She apologized and said that the meal would be no charge. I thanked her and asked for a refill on the coffee...

A few minutes more and another cup of coffee finally shows up. 

Another 15-20 minutes will go by before the ""chef"" personally delivers my order. 

The ""chef"" apologized, said that they were very busy and that there was a mix up and that it meal would be ""on him."" He placed the plate of food on the bar in front of me and quickly turned away to converse with some of what I assumed were his personal friends that had just sat a few seats down from where I was...they asked him if the game that they wanted to watch could be switched to the same tv I attempted to watch earlier. He said, ""of course!"" And, magically, the channel changed almost immediately to the game that his friends asked about.

Meanwhile, as I stare at my plate, I began to ponder over what exactly in the fuck I was looking at. I recalled that nearly an hour earlier, I had ordered a breakfast plate with eggs over easy, hash-browns, bacon, and a waffle. However, what I was looking at seemed to be brownish/black eggs over burnt to a crisp over french fries,(not hash browns), cold to the touch bacon, and waffles (the waffles looked fine)...no syrup...actually, no one asked if I wanted any condiments at all...nor any ice water...or anything else.

I pushed the plate away and again waited a few minutes for anyone to approach so that I may address the issue(s).

After a few minutes more, I placed a single dollar down on the bar, stepped down, put on my coat and left...completely unnoticed.

I will conclude with my final review:

IT IS CLEAR THAT THIS PLACE IS A GIANT STEAMING PILE OF BULLSHIT.

Thank you to the hostesses for not breaking away from your group discussion to seat me.

Thank you to the bartender(s) for taking my order In whatever timely manner accommodates your personal needs. 
Really, the coffee was fantastic...especially, when it's 30-40 minutes between top-off. 
Also, things like water and condiments would have been nice. But, I totally understand, you probably were just too busy...

And, thank you ""chef"" for personally delivering this visible plate of shit to my seat at the bar....for explaining away all the my time that you wasted by being too busy and too confused...And offering to personally pick up the tab...then immediately turning your back to take time out of your busy, confusing work day to converse to no end with your personal friends a few seats down.

I never walk into a restaurant  expecting anything for free.

What I expect is a shortlist of very basic criteria:

Reasonably polite and swift service.
And, that the food to arrive in a timely manner, well prepared, and as closely made to the way I might have ordered it. 

Today, none of this very basic criteria were even closely met.

Your pitiful explanations and pitiful offer to pick up the bill is NOT what I expected nor does it make up for your absolute incompetence In nearly every way (I mean the waffle didn't look too fucked up).

I wish you the best of luck and that we may never cross paths again.

Sincerely,
One less person for you to push your terrible service and terribly prepared food upon.

Update: still shitty"

I met a friend here for lunch and we were promptly seated. Our waitress was really nice and very attentive... drinks always refilled without having to ask and our order was taken quickly. She even gave us drinks in to-go cups after we paid our bill. Nice touch.

As for the food... it's so-so. We had some wings for appetizers, kind of small, not that juicy, nor were they spicy. But they came out fast... my guess is that they're warming them up rather than deep frying them.

I ordered the grilled Mahi Mahi. The description said it was cooked in a garlicky butter sauce but I couldn't taste it. It was rather bland. I think I picked a meal that was too healthy... it just lacked flavor.

The manager stopped by once to make sure everything was ok. The keyword is 'once'! That's a good thing in my book!! There are too many restaurants where the manager stops by 4 or 5 times interrupting your meal / conversation... once is all you need. Plus this guy looked a little scary but he was really nice.

I forgot to ask how my friends lunch tasted, but it looked pretty delicious. I wish I ordered what he had (some kind of burger).

Overall it's a nice place, great atmosphere... it's probably a fun place to go watch a Browns or Cavs game, have some drinks (good beer selection). I would recommend it if you're in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way to go there."

I got a bacon BBQ burger which was really great! And my sister got the bison burger. She didn't like it too much... she asked for medium rare and it came out well. She is also never impressed with anyone's food but her own LOL. 

One thing they do here that I think is clutch for a good restaurant is they make their own sauces with their personal twist. They had a red pepper aoli and cilantro ranch, both of which were bomb af!

I stated this was fine, we were looking to have dinner not drinks. She stated we weren't welcome to stay because my friend was obviously drunk and they didn't want ""people like us"" there bothering the other guests.  No one was drunk or even drinking.

Quite possibly the best laid-back atmosphere. Possibly biased because I'm a Texan (and this is a Texas-based company), but the service here is amazing, the food is pretty darn good, and the environment is awesome.

Jessica, my favorite waitress, is quite possibly the best server I've ever come across. It's like she's a freaking genie. I've set down half-empty cups, went back to reach for it again and find a full cup never realizing she had been there. Super attentive and the sweetest personality, she's the main reason I keep coming back again and again.

The food is good. A solid 'tavern-style' menu....lots of fried goods, finger foods, and even some decent more traditional entrees (which I honestly didn't expect). 

The pretzel sticks are a must as well as the sweet and spicy shrimp (deep fried hot peppers anyone?! LOVE them). Huge fan of the deep fried zucchini as well.

As far as main meals go, the salads suck. But let's be honest. You don't go to a place like this and order a darn salad. The mahi-mahi is shockingly good. Flaky, sweet, cooked perfectly. Goes great with cajun dusted fries. The burgers are all fantastic with the Black and Bleu being my absolute favorite.

The food, the friendly staff, the overal ambiance of the place- it's all spot on.  It's a great place to go to grab a bite to eat and/or a drink with friends and just relax.  

 For the true American man who like to sit on the couch and watch some good old fashioned TV while they eat, they've got TV's everyehere and couches, yes i said that correctly, COUCHES as well as arm chairs with detchable trays. Or if you're just looking for somewhere to bunker down with some friends for a couple hours to watch your favorite teams on a big screen with a few beers then this is the place for you.  They have couches and beer bongs.  Need i say more?

For us women out there that might be looking for a little more ambiance than big screens and couches in our dinner plans, they've also got regular tables, booths and outdoor patio seating where you can just sit, chat and take in the awesome food and decor.  They have 2 huge, awesome fireplaces- one in door and one out door that are just beautiful to take in.The sayings on the walls are hilarious so take a second to read them all (my personal favorite is ""I drink to make other people more interesting""  ;-)), there is framed underwear outside the restroom doors (a thong indicating the women's room and boxers indicating the men's room) and just in case that all wasn't great enough- there is a little bit of framed eye candy in the restrooms as well.  Don't worry it's nothing graphic that you would want to hid your childrens eyes from, but just enough to put a smile on your face ;-)  

The food is really quite good- kind of like bar fare with a little bit of a high end twist- and it really works.  I've been there 4 or 5 times, have had something different everytime, and have yet to be disappointed.  The drinks are awesome as well.  I highly reccomend the ""Bee's Knees"" if you're into mixed drinks- it's a bit sweet so you'll probably only want to do one or 2 of them but frankly, that's all most people have with dinner anyways so it's perfect. 

And for those of you that were concerned with the waitress' dress code... that is a non-issue anymore.  They have standard clothes on these days so no need to shy away from coming back.

My only 2 complaints would be that I wish they had some more healthy options on the menu.  And once they address that, they should move closer to my house ;-)"

They were part of their Saturday Special which included a huge pork chop a dish for which they are apparently ""known"", and 1/3 of a rack of ribs.....PLENTY of food, even if you just got done appearing on ""Naked and Afraid.""
OK, I promise no more quotation marks.
Wings are drum portion only and are fully the size of a chicken leg.
Trying them was a major reason for ordering the dish, so I could try them without committing my entire meal to their palatability.
Expertly prepared and sauced in a spicy/sweet sauce that complimented them nicely. A definite recommendation for anyone to try.
The chop was reasonably tender the marinade was decent enough, haven't gotten chops out much, but these were probably the best I've had.
The ribs were OK, but nothing for any self-respecting rib-house to fear.
The dish was served with their house sauced white beans which were a decent enough accompaniment, but not especially noteworthy.
My wife got their filet Benedict which she praised effusively.
Service was quite good, the manager usually checks in during the meal and is quite personable.
A notch above the standard sports bar, with great ambiance and plush seating."

The menu looked really good, so I chose a grilled chicken sandwich.

The chicken was not a fresh grilled breast. It tasted like a frozen, ""pre-grilled"", rubbery chicken breast. I was quite surprised at this, but the whole sandwich was just chewy and spongey. My salad was a little boring.

The service was good and our waitress was pleasant.

I had 2 glasses plus a small order of food. The food was ok. Nothing to rave about, and nothing I would go back for. I can find better food at better restaurants. But, come time to pay my bill...and I was charged $9.50 for each glass of wine! There was no special happy hour wine list that I had to choose off of and the bartender never said ""oh well you can actually such and such wine for cheaper during happy hour."" Needless to say I wasn't happy about it. I would never pay that much for a glass of wine at this basic kind of restaurant. I would only go back for the happy hour special of $3 craft beers on draft.

We keep forgetting to go when there are large sporting events... but this is really a sports bar with a larger than expected menu.

You have 4 options of seating... the bar... tables / booths... couches... recliners.

The tables at the couches are a bit too tall for me... it feels like the kiddie table... so we stick with a regular table if possible.

Service varies... sometimes the staff could care less... but there are 2 waitresses that are really good with refills and check backs.

Tonight we started with the cheese board... never enough bread... more than enough ""stuff"" for 3 or 4 people.... strong brown mustard that never feels at home with the Brie or the Goat or the Cheddah... but over all a good $10 buy

Our favorite for a while was the deviled eggs... oh the joy of great bacon!

Hubby's fish and chips were OK... not stellar... but good.

My black and blue burger was a perfect medium with a nice amount of grilled onion and just enough blue cheese.

The place wasn't super busy, but there were still plenty of people eating. When we walked in we were not greeted by the gaggle of hostesses standing by the door, in fact the didn't say a single word to us, but looked very annoyed that we happened to walk in the door right then. One of them quickly grabbed two menus, rolled her eyes at us and started walking away, before I realized we were supposed to be following her, I asked for a table on the patio. Begrudgingly she took us outside and sat us without another word.

I was going to let this all slide as ill-tempered hostesses. Fine. Our server was friendly and happy to help us with a drink order. We ordered the calamari, fried zucchini and the greek meatballs to share based on recommendations here on yelp. The food came out quickly and we dug in. The calamari was cooked well, not rubbery. The fried zucchini was bland and tasted like old flyer oil, maybe an off night right? The meatballs were just plain terrible. Flavorless, soggy, lumps of meatloaf with mashed cucumbers under them. We finished maybe half of each platter.

I don't normally write reviews here, and I don't like to complain, but the whole experience was just plain bad. The worst part of it, by the time my girlfriend and I got home we both felt ill. Maybe too much deep fried food? Maybe bad meatballs? I don't know. Either way I spent the rest of my night in the bathroom. Fair warning to any future guests."

We got the Sweet n Sour Tails for an appetizer and while they reminded us of a similar dish at Red Lobster that we like, they were really nicely done -- not too hot, but the heat could be adjusted by eating the fried jalapenos for those who like it hot. I chose the special of the day, the Mahi Mahi fishsticks with fries and fruit salad. Boyfriend chose the pork chops and mashed potatoes. Everything was really good -- it's one of the few times I've heard my boyfriend say that everything in his meal was good (and we've been together for 9 years, so that's saying something). And I really enjoyed my fishsticks -- they were high quality and yummy. Even the fruit salad had some extra care put into it with strawberries, watermelon, mint and grilled peaches.

The first time was... awkward, even for my male companion, who should have been the one enjoying it. That visit was shortly after they opened, and employed  scantily-clad women to chat up the male customers as they perused the menu and stole quick (but obvious) glances to check out the warm, um... atmosphere.  

Not to be deterred by serving a table for two which included 1 female, our  fetching young server made herself more than comfortable, sitting down for a chat after taking our orders. Really? We had gone to lunch to try the food and have a conversation while not having to prepare and serve our own food. Apparently we sent a signal that we wanted to discuss our upcoming holiday weekend (only one of the various pleasantries attempted) with a skinny, surgically enhanced stranger clad in bare-midriff. It was so awkward, both of us declared it ridiculous - so much so, that it was at least a year before we returned. In fact, neither of us remembered the food. I guess that should have been a tip-off for any future visits. 

Visit #2 - I don't recall what my friend ordered, but I had a piece of fish. A really really large piece of fish. Large as in - I now think I know where the word ""codpiece"" came from. I was certain that upon lifting this piece of fish, I would find the lost city of Atlantis beneath it. As far as the flavor - meh - pretty much bland - but I think i was turned off by the size. I'm not fond of taking ""fish"" home in a takeout container. I might as well toss it into the trash. Upon further inspection, I found it to be eclipsing a serving of haricot verts and some sort of potato hash - neither one being a side dish I would go back for. The best thing about this visit was the noticeable change in servers. Gone were the briefly-attired females.. replaced by respectfully dressed male servers throughout the dining room. So there was that. 

Last week - This was a ""joke gift"" visit. A friend had purchased a gift card, not realizing that the place was no longer a thinly veiled Hooters restaurant. 
I hoped for the best when I opted to stick with a wedge salad, and requested dressing on the side (the choice was bleu cheese), and SANS bacon. My friend ordered the ribs, and we asked for the Sweet and Spicy Tails appetizer, described as follows: crispy shrimp, cherry peppers, fresh cilantro, lime & sweet chili sauce. 

The appetizer arrived, and we were thrilled when we first saw the portion size. Thrilled until we realized that there were only 5 very ordinary medium-sized shrimp  for which we practically needed a search party, among a huge portion of crispy fried onions. We are not onion lovers, so had we realized the appetizer was mainly  the onions with a couple of shrimp, we would have likely chosen differently. 

Our food arrived, and my friend pronounced the ribs ""OK"". The real freak show here was my salad, which was not just a wedge, but possibly an entire head of iceberg lettuce, chopped into 3 portions and placed core-down on the plate, with (can you guess?) bacon decorating it. I started to point them out to the waitress and she looked closely, declaring them to be pecans. Yikes. Absolutely bacon. The dressing was from a bottle. No bread was served, other than two pieces of toasted white bread (fresh from the wonder bread wrapper, no doubt) that came with my friend's rib entree. 

The one star? For the interior - the large fire in the oversize see-through fireplace as you enter is warm and inviting. The place was nearly empty on a Thursday evening, while the other area restaurants appeared to be packed. Brick House really needs to upgrade their food to bring me back. So much great indie local fare, why bother with a chain restaurant serving very average fare?"

I wouldn't have recommended this restaurant to families last year due to the barely there outfits the waitresses USE TO wear.

When we got the bill, we were pleasantly surprised to learn that craft beers are $3/pint during Happy Hour.  The selection was above average...esp at that price!

I had the Turkey Club with tater tots.  It was ok.  Nothing wrong, nothing special.  I was excited to see that it included their signature deviled eggs as I am a deviled egg fan.  Unfortunately, they were not to my liking.  My husband enjoyed his burger.  So, that may be the way to go.

As a guy, I would be lying if I said I wasn't slightly disappointed when they went from scantily clad to mostly clad.  At least they are still easy on the eyes (how do they do this?).  Anyway..in my opinion the food is overpriced but decent.  Not gourmet, but decent.  The best thing on the menu is the Yardbird chicken sandwich with tater tots.  Very Good!

I do like the atmosphere, patio is nice, as are the fireplaces.  Nice place to take a date.  But the seats at the bar are so worn and rickety, you are constantly wondering when they are going to collapse and make you look like a fool in front of the cute staff!

Usually I crave restaurants that are consistent. But Brick House is consistently terrible at timing the arrival of appetizers and entrees. This happens all the time! You get your appetizers, then the food shows up before you can take a bite. I hate that. I wanted to give two stars, but some of the food is actually tasty, so they get three.

We don't even order our food and appetizers at the same time because of this issue. I guess you have to wait until the appetizers arrive to order entrees if you want to enjoy them.

There's some tasty treats here that I recommend - zucchini curls, the breading is really tasty and I like the parmesan cheese on top. However, they ran out of siracha ranch and instead of making more, brought out regular ranch. Huh? Go make more. Which is what they did, when I asked them to please bring the correct dipping sauce.

My husband ordered the meatloaf, which sounded interesting. It was very tasty. I would order that on a future visit. 

I like the French Onion soup - my mom doesn't like that they use smoked provolone, but I thought it was still good and would order again soon.

The calamari is a super treat - with large whole pieces, not the little crappy rings you find elsewhere.

I ordered the roast chicken - which really was grilled, but a whole half! That's a lot of chicken. I really would have preferred a veggie with this instead of just mashed potatoes. And the potatoes were listed as including cheddar but I had none of that. My husband's potatoes too - maybe they ran out!

My parents order the same items every time (pretzel stick appetizer), mahi mahi, and either fish n chips or shrimp (sometimes fries, sometimes tots - I love that they have tots, I am such a fan!).

I do not recommend the mac and cheese. It's terrible. They served it to me cold - not hot at all. Then I requested they add a few little bits of jalapeno - I got a boat load of teensy tiny jalapenos - they covered at least a 1/2 inch at the bottom of the bowl. And the bacon was gross - it was too fatty and in huge chunks. This made the entire thing pretty much inedible. Then, they served it to me cold. Yes, not hot, not warm, cool. How did they make it right? They reheated it! Yuck. Now it was dryer than the desert. How did they make it right? They took it off the bill. It still doesn't erase the memories of that disgusting dish.

Oh - I know I'll be back because my parents are regular diners there - so it's their go-to place. Plus, compared to nearby restaurants like Olive Garden or Applebees (bleh Chains), this has less crowd and more space. I like the fire. I love the patio. I like the bar. I like the stylish seating areas even though my folks require a table."

Such overt sexism is normally reserved for the strip clubs.  Last year, a growing chain named the Brick House opened up what is most like an upscale Hooters on Howe Ave. in the Falls, just a few hundred feet northwest of Chapel Hill Mall.  In day 4 of the Alcoholocaust (what I'm calling my last week in Akron), a friend and I went to visit this place to watch the Tribe game and get drunk.

This is a man's place.  If you are a woman, there's a good chance you won't enjoy being here - especially like the guys do.  We came into the place to see girls ranked anywhere from 4-8 on a 1-10 scale dressed in short shorts and shirts exposing part of their stomachs.  My friend and I would intentionally order beers from the lower racks just to see them bend over, but they are only dressing that way to tease you.  They aren't supposed to bend over completely, which is a let down for a lot of guys (I'm here for the game and beer, so it wasn't a biggie).  They have a large number of TVs within the place, as well as a lounge area for the guys to just chillax.  And, of course, there's the average-to-hot waitresses to socialize with.

The first thing we noticed (other than the girls) was how much money was shelled into the layout.  The bar had a fireplace, an expensive paint job, upscale lighting, and an all-wooden patio.  No other place would throw in $1 million to make a dining and/or drinking experience this nice.  The next thing we noticed was the beer selection.  The beer selection is impressive for a chain.  They have the shitty domestic beers, but then you work your way up to microbrews such as Thirsty Dog, Hop Devil, and Pilsner Urquell.  They also have an average menu serving food of average quality.  We ordered some wings that were dipped in 4 different sauces and served with celery.  The wings were acceptable, but it was really obvious that they were frozen at one point; they had that formaldehyde-ish taste that Wing Street and The Lube have.  Everything here is quite overpriced, despite the better-than-average selection.  The average price for a beer was $4.50, while the average price for a shot was well over $7.

At the end of the night, the Tribe blew a 3-0 lead thanks to the wonderfully predictable pitching of Joe Smith, and we were hammered.  I was even talking about how much I love Yelping (which I never talk about with non-Yelp friends unless they ask).  While I has happy with the girls and the selection, a $20 tab for a Washington Apple, a Hop Devil, a PBR, and wings might be a few bucks more than at other bars I can be found at in Akron.  If you are into an upscale drinking experience and are fine with restaurants that exploit the female body such as this, then this is the place for you.  If not, you are better off staying home."

As far as happy hour specials, I think it's a fair assumption to say that Brickhouse has the best happy hour specials in the Cuyahoga Falls area. Drinks are cheap and selected apps are half off. Totally worth it!

It was an amazing experiance and I loved every second of it. I made some amazing friends and had a blast everyday at work. The managment was pretty shakey when they first opened. We had like 3 managers within the first 6 months. But our bar manager was AMAZING.The drinks are poured strong, and accurately. The kitchen staff works very hard. And the girls bust their butts.
As far as the food goes; COME ONE PEOPLE... Its a bar! Its not a gourmet 5 star restraunt. The burgers arent that good. The Kobe is just ok. The Mahi Mahi is delicious (in the fish sandwich) The philly cheesesteak is sooo good. Make sure you get peppers and onions. Chicken in waffles is good as well. Drunkin pork chops are moist, perfectly cooked, and the sauce is amazing. All of the apps are good. The wings are kind of average ( i am a wing snob )
Since I havent been working there I see they have added more items to the menu.
Cant wait to go in and check them out.

To the women who was like ""omg there was T & A EVERYWHERE!!!""
Come on. We were never aloud to have our butts hanging out of our shorts.
And yeah ok some girls might have big boobs and heaven forbid are showing some clevage. I just think its so funny how narrow minded people can be.
'they must all be hookers!"" Yeah right lady. Every girl likes the outfit, wears it proud with confidence, and busts her ASS on a daily basis. I made soooo much money when I worked there. And no, not because I was showing the world all of my ASSets. But because  I am nice, I work hard, and I am a great waitress.
So suck it!

I have tried a decent amount of entrees and appetizers, nothing has ever been great. The soup was cold and smaller than a cup in my opinion. The just menu had just been changed (at least the grilled cheese description) I received a combination of what was on the old menu and new menu on my sandwich. I didn't complain because it was grilled cheese can't really mess that up too bad. BUT the soup was cold. I always ask for my pizza to be well done, it has been made well done ONCE of the 5 times I've asked.

This location is convenient to me and I needed soccer shoes for my son, so I stopped in for the first time after viewing their products online and saw they had decent sale prices for shoes I was looking for. Firstly, almost none of the shoes were priced. There was a table that appeared to be sale items, but only some of those were priced as well, and not with their sale prices. When I asked an employee, he told me they didn't tag any of the shoes and they start around $95, and tried to walk away. I asked him about shoes on sale, he said the shoes on the table were half off but those are the only sizes they have, then continued to walk away and said he'd help us in a minute - but there were no other customers in the store and he never came back to help us. Horrible customer service. Horrible merchandising - I would have probably bought something if I knew how much items were. I will not be returning to this store, and will steer people I know away from this place."

Being a business owner myself I really couldn't relate to the lack of attention they provided to meet customers expectations.

Since both my kids play club soccer and their team is sponsored by Soccer Zone I was not only forced to return but now must deal with my kids wearing that brand across their chest.

Today after practice I headed over to grab some shoes for my little boy.  I walked inside at 19:03 (7:03pm).  I noticed the sign on the door said closed but the operation times on the door indicated what looked like 8:00.  Either way the employee working there said nothing to me as I started to look at the shoe selection.  

When the other patrons walked out I approached the employee and ask to see shoes in my little boy's size.  The employee told me they close at 7 and he couldn't help me.  Now mind you, I was there for 11 minutes and at no time did he tell me that they were closed and I would not be assisted.  I have also left hundred of dollars at this location.  Just recently I purchased over $360 of practice uniforms.  The shoes I was looking for would of most likely been in the $60 to 90 range and I would of needed a second pair.

I am a good customer with good money ready to spend and you're not going to assist me because I walked in 3 minutes after closing? I don't know what the customer acquisition cost is but I can bet it is higher than that employee's pay for the additional 30 minutes he would have had to invest.

On my return home I announced a new rule.  We buy nothing from soccer zone that we can get elsewhere! With on line shopping becoming more and more convenient, brick and mortar locations can't compete pride wise.  All they have left is the personal touch, better service and a heightened customer experience.  Soccer Zone is missing the mark and a place I would recommend people stay away from."

The ice cream is out of this world! First impression: the place was empty on a Sunday after church.....surprisingly. The gentleman behind the counter did not seem very friendly. We did not initially realize it was a ""marble slab"" style ice cream place similar to Cold Stone. We told the guy right off we had an Entertainment Book coupon (Maybe why he was stand-offish?) I got peanut butter with chocolate chips added in in a waffle cone. It was the best peanut butter ice cream I have EVER had. And trust me, at 53 I  have had a LOT! The cone was equally impressive: Thick but not hard, very fresh and did not crumble as some waffle cones so easily do! Cost with coupon for two was $4.73  (including a $1 tip). My husband chatted the guy up and apparently he's the owner jointly with his Dad. I highly recommend trying it out I  believe we will go back even without a coupon! The cone is big enough to get one could easily with two spoons. With a portion of friendliness and more advertising this place should be standing room only all summer! We drove from Robinson area to use a Groupon at Bella Fruttetto THEN ice cream here for dessert. BOTH great eats!!!"

You get a generous portion servings and decent amount of toppings. There are a good amount of options to add to the ice cream which I enjoy.
The servers were super nice but didn't really say much. I thought it was overall a good experience to get ice cream. It is definitely worth at least one stop if you like ice cream."

I've had my Camaro for a little over 3 years, and it has definitely seen its share of dirt, grime, and, of course, dog hair. After procrastinating for several months, I finally decided to treat myself and schedule a detailing appointment for my car. 

Following a quick search on yelp, I decided to go with 'Detailing Gone Mobile'. In sum, I could not have chosen a better company to work with. This experience was unlike the other detailing (mobile or otherwise) experiences that I have had in the past, and I was completely taken aback.

For starters, Brandon arrived 10 minutes early to my home (not 10 or 20 minutes late, as I have had to deal with before); he greeted me with a smile, handshake, and a mention of my name before I could even introduce myself; and he worked harder and with more accountability than I had ever seen anyone work before. He actually seemed interested in making my car look gorgeous.

To make a long story short, my car hasn't been this clean since driving it off of the Chevy lot in 2011. Yes, even after getting it detailed in the past. Magically, Brandon got every last dog hair out of the mats and seats, the dirt out of crevices I thought it would be stuck in forever, and he gave my car's exterior the brand-new shine that I thought was only a distant memory. Considering the quality of work that was done, the price that I paid was beyond reasonable. 

I will sleep better tonight for two reasons: first, because my car is looking incredibly beautiful, as she should; second, because I will never, ever again have to search and mull over my options for another mobile detailing company. I've found my guy!

Thanks Brandon!! =)"

He is so meticulous in his work and he made sure that my Tahoe was clean from top to bottom, inside and out.

Appointment was scheduled at 9am...he arrived at 8:45am.  He greeted me with a handshake, called me by name and was ready to start - courteous, friendly, respectful and professional!

Brandon spent 11 hours on our Audi Q7 - I've never seen such attention to detail, patience and effort put into work like I saw with Brandon throughout the day!  To say he loves what he does doesn't say it well enough -- he is COMMITTED AND PASSIONATE to/about his work and therefore his reputation.  Brandon's name is on my car and I recommend him 150%!

There's no doubt in my mind that Brandon will be doing this full-time and grow his business in no time!  I will be telling all of my co-workers and friends about Detailing Gone Mobile -- my reputation will improve as a result!

The service was good -- not the fastest coffee I've ever gotten -- but my Hawaiian Caramel Salt Iced Latte was excellent. I also ordered a blondie, something my mom used to make for me as a treat, so I was really happy to see that on the menu. I was a little turned off when it came out of a box, but it was pretty comparable to my mom's blondies, so I can't complain. 

The store was very clean and nicely decorated. A woman commented on the Labrador Granite countertops while I was there, which apparently means something. The shop had a very earthly feel about it. Four or five wooden high top tables made it a nice place to go and get some work done. Free Wifi -- something I feel like should be synonymous with ""coffeeshop."" The highest ticket menu item is a penny shy of $8. There are paninis, sandwiches, salads, etc... so it's really affordable, though I can't attest to the quality of food today, I'll definitely be back.

Another big plus for me was the music selection: today's alternative rock with a few throwbacks. My favorite was a blues rock rendition of Kanye & Jamie Foxx's ""Gold Digger.""  

Honestly, I'm just trying to figure out how I'm the first person to review this place. There were good people, good vibes, and good coffee. This might be the best kept secret of Houston, Pa."

I'm going to name names as well because these people are exceptional in the work they are performing and when I say that it's because not even once have I ever felt like they could have done better or listened more. First William McBride is an absolutely amazing individual. He is not your normal employee or Manager by any means! He will go far in his career by virtue of his attitude, professionalism, attention to detail and amazingly genuine positive and joyful personality. I've seen him under pressure and when things were not the best and he every time kept things positive. 
Patrick Burns I have not known as long but what an amazing and serious hard working smart individual! He is what I would call professional/serious/friendly all at once, just like that! Finally Jenn Sims, she is the absolute sweetest, friendly hardworking lady you will ever meet!

Yes, this place is old and hasn't been updated in a long long time. That's part of the charm of this old, breakfast diner type place. I'm actually shocked to see people comment on decor and lack of wifi. Are you kidding me? You're here to have a cheap breakfast while supporting a small business that's been around for years. I didn't realize you needed Internet access for that. The sandwiches are amazing. I'm addicted to the bacon and pea meal bacon sandwiches! The only cons I can think of is the wait time can be long during peak hours but again it's a small place and unfortunately that can be the case. Also I find the homefries could be cooked longer! If you're that big of a snob that you need fancy decor and wifi to be happy eating your $8 dollar breakfast....go somewhere else."

The paunchier waitress with the blond ponytail nearly accused us of being bad customers by saying ""I said it's coming out....I said I think I see your order in the kitchen..."" ..........no apologies or ""sorry for the wait""....as if it was our fault. 

I think Public Health should also be called in to take a look at this greasy spoon because if they saw the state of their washrooms, peeling wallpaper, and poor ventilation anybody would lose their appetite."

Everything looks and tastes OH SO GOOD. My favourite is their waffles with strawberries, whipped cream and bacon, definitely better than cora's waffles in quality and price (sorry to all the cora fanatics out there). Besides the waffles, I would highly recommend their cheese danishes, milkshakes, turkey pies, bagels, cheesecake, grilled cheese, scones, and soup. That's basically all the things I have tried at T&T!

The decor is old. Tables and chairs are limited. Very busy, almost always. You have to pre pay for your food and there is no table service. 

Moving onto the food. It can be hit and miss. I've had great breakfast here, nothing spectacular, as you would expect since it's so cheap. 

Service is whatever. Again, can't expect much from a place like this.

They have the very best blueberry pancakes and bacon, made fresh, which is my favourite thing to order, but everything on the board is tasty and fresh. They also have daily lunch specials such as pierogies and polish sausage with sauerkraut and pretty good sandwiches as well. A popular item they have is homemade quiche, different ones each day and they are definitely worth trying for lunch. The prices are very reasonable but it gets quite busy at lunchtime and on weekends so finding a table can be difficult, especially with a bigger group. 
The treats and desserts are also very yummy. They make cookies, squares and tarts and sometimes there is even homemade bread pudding which is de-lish! I most definitely recommend this place. It is also worth mentioning that they do big lunch platters for events if you call ahead."

Friendly staff, Good prices for their breakfast specials - I had scrambled eggs with (3)bacon and potatoes and toast - which was priced under $7.

Strange that coffee refill is (81 cents as i recall)

I gave this breakfast experience 2.5 stars because i suggested having breakfast here to my sister whom was visiting from Ottawa.  Everything was good, up to paying for the food - Its cash only !! So i had to borrow $$ from my sister.  Then when we sat down, there was 6 of us, we waited.... and waited... and waited.. I know that restaurants like to bring the table all the meals at once, but we didnt order anything out of the ordinary.. We ordered the french toast special and the eggs/bacon special.  I believe it took..over 25 mins. And my sister pointed out that people that came after us were getting their food first.

Bacon was salty and you can see the grease on it. Everything else was fine.

Table was a bit sticky.

I think the wait time killed this experience. Go as a couple!!

T & T is not about being upscale or trendy, at ALL. It's a family-run place with outdated decor and basic, fresh food which is almost always delicious and is consistent. 

Yummy breakfasts and sandwiches, delicious quiche and salad combo every day (I don't know how they keep their salad so fresh!), and many delish desserts, some of which are made in house. They do take out and also pre-orders for parties and such. 

Because it has become a mainstay for those who are regulars, it is ALWAYS busy, but we seem to get a table even so. Sometimes the family and employees are a little harangued but it's always a good meal.

While the staff can be a little impatient, the service is great overall, and the food is fantastic. Their homemade pies and soups are my favourite things to order. Everything is homemade from scratch (from what I know) and you can really tell. Plus, the prices are fantastic for what you get!

I was hoping we could all sit together but given the fact the place was very busy we couldn't.   The place is quite quaint and has a very small town homey feel to it.  

It's a cash only place (which I don't like) and you have to go the cash first, order your breakfast that's indicated on a chalk board and pay before receiving your breakfast.  I ordered the #1, poached eggs, bacon, beans, toast and home fries with a Tea,  $9.65

There are some cons to not having table service other than having them bring you your breakfast.  If you need some water or you are missing utensils or need more napkins you will need to catch them while they bring your food to the table or you will have to trek over to the counter and interrupt the busy staff. However; when I did ask to have our table wiped before eating (since the table was not cleared from the previous customers) they did so promptly.  

I saw a staff member handwashing dishes and cups at the counter.  I don't like the fact that the dishes are handwashed instead of using a dishwasher that washes and sterilizes but I guess they like to keep it old school. While waiting for our breakfast (tick tock) the power in the kitchen went out and the cook came out using profanities drawing minor attention from customers.  I'm sure he was frustrated, but somehow worked his magic because before I knew it, my breakfast was before me.  

Any preconceived notions I had about the breakfast place we're soon forgotten.  Presentation lacked a little but the taste and quality of the food more than made up for any short comings up to that point.  The whites of the 2 poached eggs were a little runny, however; the 3 slices of  bacon was cooked to perfection and the baked beans were heavenly.   I was never a fan of homefries,   but these were lightly seasoned grill fried and delicious.   I am a very critical person especially when it comes to food and service and they passed with flying colours.  

The atmosphere is a little hectic (at least when I was there) and I would not recommend this place if you are coming with a large group (5 or more), with that said....This is probably one of the most enjoyable breakfasts I've had."

Did not read the other reviews prior to my visit so was pleasantly surprised how comforting this place was at first glance.

The place was more than 50% packed on a Sunday late morning.

The menu seemed equally comforting.  I looked around and saw most eating breakfast plates:  eggs, bacon, toast, home fries...typical breakfast items.   The other popular dish seemed to be their in-house baked bagel sandwich with bacon.

We decided to try their waffles with strawberries and an item from their lunch menu (which is offered for breakfast times too!), a chicken pie with salad.  Both were tasty and a nice portion for brunch.

I give 3.5 stars for the food but what I cannot stand are flies so the experience made it short of a 4 star experience.

I didn't ask but it tasted homemade. The soup was full of flavor and wasn't too salty. The weakest item was the turkey pie which tasted sightly sour. I should've went with my gut and got the beef pie which I expect would've tasted better.

If classic food is your fix you have to come here.  Everything is made fresh to order and or was made that day. Breads, buns, burgers and all. The portions are huge and will take you out for the day. 

Coffee is a classic boiler which I won't talk about.  
I had the Handmade burger which was huge and nice, but this is no gourmet burger. Think 70's diner burgers that are simple and had your classic toppings.  The home fries are a classic made plate of joy. 
The bread Pudding is most likely a way they use day old bread and it is perfect in its simplicity. No too sweet and no nuts or added things. 

The hot items are the meat pies, schnitzel, and some of the other European favourites.  I'm assuming they are Polish or German background family. 

Some of the cakes are not made there so stick with the pastries and pies which all look like they are made like they should.  

The big surprise to me was Cash Only. So bring your cash. No debit, no visa, nothing. So I actually had to go down the street to the atm to get money.

I've had pretty much every item on the breakfast menu over the years and all great. Fresh cooked and delivered to your table. At T&T you order at the front counter and than find a table. During the week, this can be an easy task, on weekends, look out, get there early, there is a lot of turn away business. It appears to be run by a family who takes their work very seriously. The other thing I like is, they have no problems with custom orders. They have a menu on the wall for breakfast with about 6 items, if you don't see an item you like, just ask, and there will be no problem. The only minor issue is I don't like the coffee, it could be a bit richer and perhaps stronger, but this is minor. 

If you are in the mood for some fresh baked goods for breakfast or a good ole diner style breakfast, then T&T is the place for you.... make sure you try the bacon, its not the usual out of the plastic bag bacon, they must get is custom from somewhere.....

But I believe you should not judge too harshly based on one visit. Everyone has an off day, right? Well, this was my fifth time here and for sure my last. The only reason I came back was because my husband said he really liked it. Why, I have no idea. I guess that's not saying much for me as his chosen wife, but that's a whole other issue. Let's get on with this Yelper's first ever one-star review:

When we arrived, we grabbed the only available table near a drafty door. The table was covered in maple syrup. I asked for it to wiped off, please, and headed downstairs to the dreaded T&T bathroom to wash my sticky hands. I'd read about their state in previous reviews but it was even worse than described. Dirty, dark and dingy with the cheapest fixtures and linoleum tile floor. I swear this whole place has not been redecorated since 1972. Ugh!

We ordered our usual #2 special; 2 eggs, toast, bacon, hash browns and a cup of coffee. I asked to sub a tea biscuit for the toast, warmed up and with butter on the side. When my plate was placed in front of me 30 minutes later, I couldn't believe my eyes. The tea biscuit was smeared with a thick layer of butter and it was clearly stone cold as the butter was a solid congealed mass of glistening fat. It completely turned me off my breakfast. I barely touched my cold eggs and chewy, extra thick, extra greasy bacon. Ugh!

Not only that. While we waited and waited and waited some more for our breakfast to arrive, I finished my cup of weak coffee. Since no one had come by to offer a refill, I went to the counter where I was curtly told that refills are75 cents. In cash. Pre-paid.

Really??

So I went back to my table to scrounge up exact change 'cause there was no way in hell I was tipping that! 

Oh yes, and they don't have Wifi. Ugh!

Top Must-Get: chicken cutlet in a sandwich
Top Regret: pies

One of the busiest restaurants on Main Street Markham is this family-run bakery that offers awesome specials and fresh goods and pastries. It is a local favourite and gets PACKED. Parking is brutal (try the back) and if you get here after 12:30 pm for lunch, expect a 15-20 minute wait in line, plus 15-20 minutes for food. That's right - possibly forty minutes wait time for your food...

And yet the lines have stayed long all these years because they've got some pretty good stuff. They preach quality over quantity (one meal doesn't come close to filling me) and make everything on the spot.

They have breakfast and lunch specials on a whiteboard on the right hand side when you walk in through the main doors. The full menu hangs from the top and consists of all their pastries and baked goods.

Chicken cutlet: crunchy and evenly breaded, and tender!

Home fries: they're okay - clearly rushed when cutting and seasoning. They're basically diced potatoes that are unevenly but heavily seasoned.

Home burger: delicious.

Beef pie: ... disappointing. It fell apart quite easily and I like my crusts a bit sturdier!

Breakfast: solid - they have a number of different specials, and I got their bacon one (comes with two eggs and home fries). Their bacon is a tad over-crispy although very limited in quantity (I think I had five strips...?) and they make their over-medium eggs slightly too well (but I'm notoriously picky when it comes to judging over-medium eggs)

I heard their quiche is good but haven't tried it yet!

Ultimately, I think it's a pretty good spot, but the line up does detract from it, and the portion sizes are not always worth that 30+ minute wait... Come early if you do!"

I only visited recently because I moved in the area. The food was really good - I got the bagel BLT which was really really good. The bagel was similar to a twister bagel you'd get at other places. They were also not cheap on bacon (which is always a good thing). My husband got the breakfast with poached eggs and was very satisfied. 

The service was good. What others said in the reviews is true - you have to get used to the idea of self service (ie picking up your own utensils, butter, etc). Also, you have to get up and pay for coffee refills. Also note, It's CASH ONLY. 

My only improvement point on this place is the cleanliness and decor. It's very old and outdated. I mention the cleanliness because I did notice maybe 4 black flies on the wall near where I was sitting :S."

They were more like used car salesmen than dentists.  I went for a second opinion (thank God) and found out my teeth were in no where near the shape they claimed.  STAY CLEAR.

UPDATE:

After several dental visits at a competent clinic, every filling that was done here needed replaced.  Of note, my supposed infected tooth was never infected and did not need a root canal or a crown.  There were also several cavities and catches I had complained about previously (which went ignored once I refused their constant hounding for 20K) that were easily cleaned and filled without incident.

I've had numerous experiences that was ALL horrible. 
First, I had an appt for the morning (around 10am) I was called at 9 and asked if I could come in at 1pm. I agreed. At 11am they called me berating me about being so late. When I tried to explain to the rude lady that I was asked to come in later she accused me of lying. I replied with yinz gotta get your sh** together. 

Second time (now don't judge me I live on the same street so it's convenient and the doctor is nice it's the front of the house that has no customer service or common sense) I chipped my tooth and need to be seen sooner than later. 

When I called the lady wanted to remind me of my last experience and how I was no longer a patient there.  After explaining what happened, Jawana told me to come now, unfortunately yesterday was a steeler game and I stayed at a buddy's house on the other side of the city. Not that this information is any of their business but I tell them it would take me about 30'min to get there. she continues to say ""you live three doors down why can't you come now""    
Like woah! I am 32 years old, and definitely not your child. Who are you to question me? I hope the doctor reads this, Bc she is actually excellent, her staff however are VERY RUDE.

The Showmars at the Government Center pretty much has a captive market due to it's location and lack of restaurants surrounding.  I came during an off lunch time, but you can see the remains of the lunch crowd that pretty much destroys the restaurant (figuratively speaking).  You walk in, and there is a sign that explicitly says to form 3 lines and the cashiers will call you went its your turn.

If you are walking to the building, you will have to go through metal detectors since the building is a secure location.  It's a little strange to feel like you need to go through security just to go to a restaurant, but hey, I get it.

Typical Showmars menu here...   items are made to order and are quickly to you after they give you a number tent and you find a table.  Since I came after the lunch rush the staff had closed of some table sections to clean, it was a little awkward when you got ""fenced in"" but easy enough to move a chair to go get a drink refill."

Brunch menu is pretty standard, but the quality of food is amazing. I got a Veggie and blue cheese wrap and it was HEAVENLY! Friends got a egg benedict and egg florentine and those were amazing too. The atmosphere was really chill, we sat there for 2 hours and no one rushed us to get the check or anything like that. It was very relaxing and comfortable.

Well, maybe I didn't cross it specifically to be my #100, but I'm in Toronto and it happened to be my #100. Now, I was worried that my excitement regarding this restaurant may have been biased. I was REALLY excited that this place was going to be the big triple digit review. However, this place was pretty fantastic. 

The ambiance here is great. Just enough tables to feel like it could be crowded, but not too many to were it loses its intimacy. Great long padded bench with tables spread out along it and some individual tables  as well. A cute little outside area (but only 2 person tables can fit...it is teany tiny!). Nice well decor, lighting, music. Cute bar with tons of wine options (or at least enough to make me happy). 

Food was pretty great too. The bread was hot and toasted just right and served with olive oil and balsamic. My pasta with sausage was great and my friend enjoyed her mussels. However, it was the frites that came along with the mussels that were pretty damn delicious. Great salty flavor with what seemed like a hint of parmesan and spice. Finish off with a perfect sized tiramisu and you'll be pleasantly satisfied. 

My sangria was great, but I don't claim to be a sangria expert (one of my favorite sangria's is made with Mad Dog 20-20...I love Dominik's!). Very fruity and I loved it. 

A couple of fun facts: All you can eat mussels Mon-Thu; They have a second location apparently but I have no clue where it is; It's been around for about 8 years (per our waiter, who was very nice) and is a local favorite; packed on weekends and they don't take reservations between 7pm-8pm on weekends; they also have a prix fixe menu for $25 (appetizer, main course, and dessert) .

Honestly, this place would be great for a casual dinner with friends or even for a date. I really enjoyed it and the food was faboo (yahoo!)

We arrive and they have given away our table because we were 10 mins late, even though I called them letting them know I will be exactly 10 minutes and they said not a problem?!?!?

So we get put at the last table at the place right by the cold window and front door :s it is a pretty small place 10-12 tables, so it was freezing there.

So we sit down and produce our voucher, which I put in my reservations with them on open table for a table of 3 people with a voucher. The server (with glasses) then proceeds to tell me they can't honor the voucher because it says 1 coupon for a table of four or 2 vouchers for tables 5 and more. I got mad at this point because that is why they have a ""note"" section on open table so you can provide extra info/requests that they are spose to look at. Wtf, he says this and then walks away as if expecting us to leave by ourselves wtf. 

No we are not incapable of paying full price but when you make your customers feel like it is their fault they didn't review their own reservations and the coupon is stupid, first time ever at any restaurant. 

So we end uP staying cuz my bestfriend's boyfriend was able to come join us *thsss lol 

So after we order our apptetizer (mussels) and entrees we wait about half an hour before our appetizer arrives, then another 45 minutes for our entrees! By the time we got our entree it was a full 1 1/2 hour after sitting down.

And while we were waiting my friend was hungry so we asked for more bread, the server came and didn't say anything and picked up the bread basket, then came back and plopped it back down! Are you kidding m?

So at this point doesn't matter how our food taste, the experience was ruined :(

Also it looks bad on me because I was the one who told my friends this place was amazing, obviously that changed!

Finally the food: caesar salad- $8 was bad in size but didn't taste it so can't comment! Mussels $7 (we ended up getting charged $9 wtf) there was 2 two bad mussels that tasted like rotten seafood! Beef dish $18 had a lot of veggies with good variety and little beef but it tasted good! The chicken ravioli came with 4 pieces and a good amount of chicken! Fair to say my guy friend was not full at all but it did taste good! I had the seafood linguine $18 which was good but also a bit salty and again one bad mussel :s for a place that has a ayce mussel nights this is pretty bad! Didn't order dessert and tipped them 12% tip and walked out knowing we would never return! Overall bad experience! :("

At the end of our meal we were surprised when they took care of our entire bill (all $110 of it!) We also identified ourselves when we made our reservations so they knew it was us from the start.

I think it is extremely commendable that the restaurant offered to make up for a previous experience. Most just wouldn't care.

With that disclaimer in mind: 

The service during this visit was impeccable. Despite the fact the restaurant was packed when we arrived we were greeted and seated right away. Throughout the evening we always felt like the most important guests in the restaurant with our food arriving quickly and our servers being careful to make sure we had everything we needed. 

The food is very simple and elegant. The ingredients are fresh. The menu is everything you'd expect from a nice Italian restaurant. My only advice would be to skip the Caesar salad, the other salads on the menu are much better.

While we ate our meal we watched Mariam, the owner, making the rounds of the restaurant making sure every table was happy with their experience. She is clearly passionate about what she does and has a real heart for her customers and her business. We couldn't help but overhear a truly genuine conversation between the couple next to us celebrating their 50th anniversary and Mariam. They were telling her how Alize is their favourite restaurant in the area. 

I'm giving this an honest 3 star review because for me, this isn't my ideal restaurant. I like restaurants that are a little darker, a little noisier, and foods that are a little more off beat and provide a 'wow' factor. 

This place will be lovely in the summer on the patio or even inside since they can open the front right up to let the warm summer breeze blow through.

Alize, thank you for a wonderful evening."

I made an OpenTable reservation with my friend for 5:30 PM; my friend was running late, so I got to push the reservations until 6:00 PM.  When I entered the restaurant, the server knew right away that I was the one that made the reservation and quickly sat us.

The waiters and waitress was absolutely awesome.  They quickly brought us water and told us about the specials that they had that day.  I ordered the seafood fettucine and my frien had the prix-fixe menu (salad, 8 oz. steak, and chocolate cake for $25).  The fettucine was superb: surprisingly quite a lot of seafood and sauce in the noodles.  

I also ordered a white chocolate, blueberry strudel for dessert.  I enjoyed how the tangy taste of the bluberries compimented the white chocolate; however, sometimes, the white chocolate overpowered the blueberries and got a tad too sweet.

Ambiance was great.  Small little restaurant, but I loved it.  Wasn't really feeling for an eclectic, large restaurant; so this was absolutely perfect.

Not knowing what to expect, since although I've heard great things about Alize in general, usually the winter/summerlicious events seem to be a mediocre sampling into what you can usually expect from the  menu.

I made a reservation for 5 people a week earlier, and when we made it at the exact time specified, we were told to wait in the cold doorway till they prepared the tables. We waited for about 10-15 minutes, and the restaurant itself wasn't very busy yet. 

The menu options were diverse and more than acceptable with 3-4 per course. I had the Potato and Leek Soup, Barbequed Salmon and Tiramisu. One of my friends thought the crepe was distinctly too dry. 

The Potato soup and Tiramisu were both very mediocre, and my biggest shocker of the night was finding a strand of black hair intertwined in my friend's entree(bbq'ed salmon). When she alerted the server, all she got was a very quiet apology, the plate was taken away and replaced. 

That's it. 

We were all left gagging for several minutes at a shocker that should have never taken place in a restaurant, much less one like Alize. Worse still, to have a similar situation addressed by the restaurant as though the salmon was just simply overcooked. 

That would have been acceptable. Hair in food, is not. 

Further, the friend and I (had the exact same choices) have been experiencing stomach trouble since last night. I suspect the salmon. It's a shame, because the restaurant itself is so cute."

I had purchased a Groupon for a 4-person prix fixe menu for $120.  The menu was as follows:
2 x Onion Soup and Crispy Parmesan Gratin
2 x Grilled Shrimp and Calamari in a Provencal sauce
2 x Atlantic Salmon on Linguine
2 x Duck Confit with Wild-Mushroom Risotto
Dessert platter for the table
Coffee/Tea

There were a total of 6 of us, and the other 2 ordered off their weekly Prix Fixe menu for $25 which includes an appetizer and entrée.  All items marked with an asterix on the menu were available options.

From the dinner prix fixe menu, we opted for the onion soup, and the organic greens.  For mains, the Beef Bourgignon and 8 oz. New York Striploin were selected.

We also ordered 2 glasses of wine, a Merlot and a Cabernet Sauvignon.  I am not a fan of red wines to begin with, but I found the Cabernet to be too sour for my taste buds.  The Merlot was much more subtle.

Upon ordering, we were brought 2 warm bread baskets.  Those of you who know me know how excited I get when I am served warm bread, or how bratty I get when I am served cold bread :p  It was a poppy seed bread served with balsamic vinaigrette and olive oil.  From what I gather, it is a store-bought bread and not bought daily as the bread, though I won't say stale was not the freshest. The French Onion Soup was disappointing to say the least.  The lack of deep onion flavour and gooey cheese coupled with a little too much wine in the broth made for a rather sour taste.  More cheese and more onions = more flavour.  The math is quite easy folks!  The only part of this dish that was tasty was the crostini. The Grilled Shrimp and Calamari in a Provencal sauce was served almost cold which was indicative that it had been waiting for awhile since the chef prepared it to reach our table.  The calamari was nicely grilled, soft and tender but unfortunately the shrimp were overcooked.  The salad came adorned with olives and a balsamic drizzle.  Overall, this dish was all one flavour - tart, mostly stemming from vinaigrette and tomatoes.  It would've been nice for some contrast.The Salmon Linguine was made with a simple sauce which really brought out the flavour of the fish.  The salmon for me was the best part as the skin was crispy and the fish was flaky.  The linguine was rather bland, with a lemon-oil drizzle.  So you can imagine how excited I was when the server brought over the Parmesan cheese for sprinkling!The Duck Confit came with your choice of sauce: veal jus, orange jus, or blueberry jus. We opted for the veal and orange jus.  The duck had a nice crisp skin, but it was more of a crust than anything else.  It resembled the texture of a chicken wing that's been sitting on the grill a little too long.  The risotto was barely warm and a bit dry.  The side vegetables were tender and savoury.

I also got to sample both the sirloin and the beef bourgignon.  The steak was quite flavourful and had a nice charred flavour to it.  Taste was all there, but texturally, it was a tad on the dry side.  The frites were amazing!  I love crispy fries.  Ketchup wasn't even on my mind when I was chowing these down.  That must be a sure sign that they were tasty?  I found the red wine in the beef bourgignon to be overpowering, but my mom thought it was fine.  My only ""beef"" about this dish is that I wish the meat were more tender.The Groupon specified that a dessert tray would be served. The serving size was more suitable for a party of 2 than it was for a party of 4.  It consisted of a Crème Brûlée, Blueberry Strudel and Raspberry Sorbet with blueberries, gooseberries and raspberries for garnish.  I was unimpressed with their  crème brûlée which was grainy and not velvety smooth.  The raspberry sorbet was quite refreshing.  The strudel was more what I would call a dessert spring roll and had a crisp exterior and yummy filling!  The house coffee was also quite good.  My parents, who you have never applauded any restaurant for good coffee finally cracked and awarded their first ever java compliment.

Verdict:

I haven't experienced service like this in a very long time.  The servers were very attentive, courteous and sported a smile.  Food-wise I was a little disappointed but it wasn't terrible.  It someone were to ask for recommendations, Alizé wouldn't be on the top of the list but if I were in the area I may eat here again... Perhaps ordering off their regular menu would serve as a better basis of comparison.  Until then, I reserve judgment."

Tonight it was not. The service was terrible, we actually had to ask to receive bread (2x), they brought the wrong entree, and then charged for both the correct one and the wrong one. The entire service took 2+ hours. Not impressed. I'm not sure if they were short-staffed, but it will definitely be a while before I chance it again."

I first came across Alize a few years ago, when I went there for dinner. The wait staff was not so good, especially for such a small, I guess you could call it cozy restaurant. The menu selection was about what you would expect from a restaurant this size. When the food got to the table it was flavorful and I was satisfied with the overall quality. 

Now with all that being said, I went back a few weeks later for their Brunch, which I have to say was FANTASTIC! selection was good and the service was better then what I had experienced last time I ate at Alize.

Hope that helps"

I asked if we could start on my pedicure while we wait for Jimmy and they accommodated me.  After 1/2 hour, I asked if Jimmy was coming back.  One of the girls brought me a cell phone and Jimmy was calling from a bar, he apologized (I think) and asked if I could come tomorrow.  I told him I was leaving for CA the next day to get married.  He told me one of the girls would do my backfill instead.  One of the girls started to do my backfill while I am still in the pedi chair, awkward and uncomfortable to say the least.  She was trying to do my nails and 2 other people at the same time.  When all was said and done, they charged me $100 for pedi and backfill, only 7 of my fingers were backfilled, the other 3 just filled, my nails were lumpy and thick and I had been there 2 1/2 hours.

And then when I questioned it, she could t clearly communicate to me what and why she was charging me for. We paid 90$ for something that was  ok.

They were very friendly at first and said pick my color and they would be right with me. Mind you there was not one other person in there when I got there. I sat and waited for 15 minutes while the employees gave each other a massage and did the other employees nails. Finally they started my nails they guy filed my skin of on 3 of my fingers. Then the lady came to fill my nails and polish them now that she was done getting her nails done. She was very pushy about other services and designs i must have told her no 15 times. Then she left me sitting for 10 minutes while she waxed a walk in eyebrows. Then when she came back she rushed thru my polish which looked lumpy and uneven.

The first time, my car just needed a standard oil change, which comes with a basic inspection. I had not been to a Meineke in the past, but thought my experience would be like those of similar businesses, such as Tires Plus, where after the inspection, someone comes to talk to you about the results of the inspection, especially if something checks off in the yellow or red ""requires attention"" category. Since no one came to talk to me about anything, I assumed all went well and checked out good in the inspection, so after paying for the oil change and just being casually handed the inspection report with no comment, I preceeded to go home. My husband reviewed the report a couple days later and noticed 3 things had been checked off in the yellow category, with no accompanying comment of how bad/unsafe/urgent the problem was, one of which was a cracked belt, which sounds pretty serious to me. I at least would have appreciated being alerted to these problems while I was there so I could ask about the severity and get more details. I also find it bad business, as, had I been alerted to the problems while I was there, I would have gotten estimates from them and considered having them fix the problems. I am surprised the mechanic nor person who rang me up cared enough about my satisfaction and business to so much as comment on the things that they deemed ""required attention"". 
The second time I visited this location, it was out of necessity, as we noticed a problem with our vehicle, and since we were right across the street from Meineke when we discovered this, out of convenience we stopped in to have it checked out. When the person called my husband to let him know the cause of the problem, it was found that a $300+ repair was needed. When my husband said he wanted to price out the job through other businesses, the employee just said ok, which is fine, but we thought it would have been good business to at least tell us if we find any competitor willing to do the job for less, they would match it, or something like that which would tell us they appreciate our business.
Since this location is so close to my residence, I really wanted to like it and give them my business, but due to my experiences here, the unfriendly and poor customer service, and them being unappreciative of my business, I will be going elsewhere."

My son and I were greeted with a smile as soon as we walked in the door. The shop is very clean, it took me back to when I was a kid... Except the had Flatscreen TV's and not the big tube TV, and ever screen had sports showing on it, not some music video with half naked women. Their chairs were the old school ones, big and comfortable!

The big seller for me, was I didn't hear one cuss word the entire time I was there. I have a 9 year old boy, and it's very important to me that he grows up a man, I know he hears   that mess in school, but if I can help minimize the amount of negativity that he absorbs in a daily bases, that's what I'll do, and that includes finding a barbershop with a positive feel like Senior's.

The stylist that used to cut my hair regularly relocated and I dreaded having to find another person to cut my hair. I wear my hair short and always find that regular stylists aren't comfortable using clippers on women's hair, and never seem to cut the back short enough (tapered). So I always end up looking like I need another haircut in a week. The trick to stop this sick cycle is to find a barber/stylist. Someone that has experience cutting both men and women's hair. And Yolanda at Senior's is definitely that kind of barber. She was great. The shop is nice and clean, the people are super nice, and I knew when she asked to see the picture of how I wanted my hair cut that I didn't have anything to worry about. She took her time (even though it was past closing time) and she got it just right. She made sure I was happy before I left. She was very personable and friendly. I will definitely be back.

Luckily Seniors Barber Shop were still open, after reading acouple reviews on Yolanda. I decided to try it out. For me getting a cut at a new spot is a big deal, I'm picky about about my hair. Cause when I go to other shops, barbers always say your hair is hard to cut. But when I got there Yolanda already knew the cut I needed before I described it to her. She's an excellent barber, she done a great job on my hair and the shop is clean and professional, I'll definitely be back."

One of Maxim's most popular cakes is definitely the meringue (mango/strawberry); they are quite pricey ($32 for an 8"") but are delicious...Two of crunchy meringue (with almonds) and fresh whipped cream in between.

They offer a wide variety of choices for cakes and have always been fresh (black forest, mango mousse, cheesecake/green tea cheesecake, white chocolate  cake, mango yogurt, mocha, many more!).

The one time I had lunch here it was very quiet. The lunch specials are more pricey than your normal westernized HK cafes (ie. Firefly) as they can be up to $13-20 for a combo...although it comes with soup, main, beverage and a slice of cake. The food itself isn't bad, but my main complaint is the pathetic size of the cake of choice... it is literally 1/2 of a normal slice..honestly I don't think it would hurt to give a full slice.. you'd win people like me over who have a sweet tooth :3.

Additionally, my other complaint would be that they charge $0.50 for a small chocolate badge if you want writing on certain cakes (i.e. the meringue). The service at the cake counter can be quite lacking although there are plenty of staff chilling behind the counter.

They accept credit card for transactions over $30."

The tart was delicious too. The chestnut cake wasn't worth it. It cost $4.50 and it only had one layer of chestnut and the meringue topping wasn't fresh. 

Definitely stick with the meringue tart and meringue cakes. 

A tip - order it the day before because I wanted to buy a cake, but it was sold out."

Worse yet is finding a small bug crawling inside the leaf of the cardboard box....

Knew that Maxim did mostly desserts and cakes, but the dinner was pretty good. We ordered off the dinner special menu, so we got soup, coffee/tea, and a slice of cake with the meal. I had Curry Lamb Shank with Wild Rice, which was very good. Rice was quite nice with a pretty soft lamb. The Seafood Paella was okay as well.

Cakes were quite nice, but ended up really full, so didn't finish it. We had the Tiramisu, Meringue, and Orange Chocolate Cake.

Service was quite good, as they were very nice. Came by often to see if we needed anything, and quite friendly!"

I came on a Saturday afternoon with my partner and the place was not extremely packed. We were taken to our tables and the waiter was quite quick to get our order. 

I ordered curry chicken with rice while my partner ordered the honey glazed pork chop. The curry tasted quite sweet, and not as curry-ish as I had expected. The chicken was alright when combined with the curry. The rice, however, was quite dry. Having it with curry didn't make it much better. As for my friend's pork chop - it tasted quite bland. It was served with cranberry sauce, which was not a good combination for my friends taste. His dish also came with steamed vegetables - which were basically frozen vegetables. They were also, quite bland. I think the only part I liked from his plate was the cranberry sauce. The portion was pretty large for both our dishes, but for the quality was a bit of a disappointment. 

Here is the main reason why we came for a visit: Dessert! I was told from my friend (we are both avid dessert lovers) His favourite being the Mango Meringue Cake offered at Maxim. However, he did warn me the cakes are sometimes really good  and sometimes average (inconsistent quality). When we tried it, the meringue was quite delicious. However, there was so much cream and not that much mango bits. So, the proportion didn't fit quite well, so the experience wasn't anything special for me. They have other cakes though. I would give them a try again, if I ever visit Toronto again. But perhaps not for the meals."

Both times I was equally satisfied with the service and food. Water was filled without you having to ask and there were enough waiters to serve everyone. 

I would classify Maxim as a more upscale HK style cafe because they have a lot of the dishes typically served in a regular HK style cafe. The two basic choices between cream and Russian borscht soup also makes me feel this way. There is plenty of variety on the menu like sandwiches, soups, salads, burgers, pasta, curry, rice, steak, lamb and, of course, cakes as they are a bakery. They have regular lunch combos if you want to be frugal, or you can spice things up with more expensive lunch or dinner specials with the choice of salad or lobster bisque as an appetizer and a slice of cake as dessert. 

For lunch I ordered some smoked salmon with shrimp pasta which was one of the lunch specials of the day with Russian borscht soup. The free bread they give you with the soup is not good at all. Very tasteless and cold. The actual soup itself was pretty good and I preferred it over the cream soup I also tried. The portion of the pasta was about average and the sauce used was not very good. However, I was able to eat the food from what my party ordered because their portions were much bigger. I really liked their Caesar salad and mashed potatoes. The deluxe club sandwich was really big and unfortunately, it was a hassle to eat because bits of tuna kept falling out. The Black Forest cake they picked out for me to eat was not to my liking, but that's only because I prefer more sweet cakes.

For dinner I ordered lamb chop with lobster bisque. The soup was made in a HK style which meant the lobster flavour was much more mild than if you were to have it at a typical western restaurant. The lamb was good quality and there was minimal amount of salt, pepper and seasoning which is what I prefer because you get a more clearer taste of the lamb. Others might find it too devoid of seasoning. Maybe it was because the restaurant was almost closing and they had to get rid of their cakes, but they let me choose what type of cake I could have for dessert this time. During my previous lunch visit, I was told there would be an extra $2 charge if I wanted to pick the cake out myself. I chose the mango cheesecake which was not very sweet again, but I guess that ends up being healthier.

All in all, this place has existed for a very long time (25+ years?) for a good reason. You might have to wait for a table on weekends. I would recommend Maxim for lunch and dinner and not for the cakes."

I ordered a cake on Sept 22 for the 8"" strawberry meringue cake for pick up on Sept 27.  Ideally, I would like another email to confirm my order is ready for pick up other than the acknowledgement that my order was placed. Anyways, when I arrived on the 27 to get the cake, none of the staff there knew about it. I had to show them my order ( btw that was already paid by cc from their online order system). And they had to scramble for 5 minutes to ask other staff if they had my order.  One of them finally called the owner I guess to confirm that my order was placed.  Luckily, they had the cake available for me to pick up but that's only because they made a bunch to sell for their display case. If I had come later during the day I'm sure they wouldn't have the cake I wanted available.

When first stepped into the restaurant, it does not have too many people.  But not an hour later it is filled and packed.  

The service is all you can say like a fast food restaurant.  The server expects you to know what to order if it is your turn.  Be quick and precise, not to hesitate.  

The food though maintains its standard.  Each of the different dishes that our group has tried has a good comment.  The club sandwich is large and thick, enough to fill up any person together with fries.  The ox tail rice unexpectedly the ox tail is cut into very thick pieces so it looks piling up on the rice.  The ox tail is very well cooked and tender but the tip you can still taste a bit of the raw tail - can be done better.  The chicken comes with a salad and rice and the portion is large.  The Borsch is tasty and a bit too much tomato paste.  Most of the sauces are really thick and can fill your stomach really fast.

The lunch serving is very slow, may be due to the number of customers."

The 8"" cake is $32 and the 6"" is around $22-$24. They have a large selection of cakes ranging from Tiramisu, Cheesecakes, Meringues, Fruit Cakes to Strawberry Shortcakes! Usually we get their green tea or New York Cheesecakes, and you can never go wrong with them, the Cheesecakes are always delicious and never too heavy.

On our latest visit to this location, my family really wanted to the 8"" mango meringue cake but unfortunately we didn't pre order it, so the one on display had been served to customers by the piece. Thankfully, there was also a strawberry meringue that was being served by the piece too and the owner was nice enough to combine what was left of the two into one whole cake! The meringue was amazing, I don't think there's anywhere else where you can get a meringue of this quality, it was nice and fluffy as well as very flavourful. This is a great cake place!"

Our waiter did not write down our selections and tried to keep it all in his mind. (9 people). He mixed up our orders and forgot one dish. He came back and said I have 3 dish 'a'. 2 dish 'b' etc. But as we didn't know what each other ordered, We had to talk amonsgt ourselves to find what he missed. 

A problem that could have been solved if he just wrote down our orders!!

All our meals came with a choce of soup. A choice that was denied to us. He just came out and brought some soups until someone from our group said 'so we don't get a choice?'. Only then did he say 'oh ya, you can also have the borsht if you want.'

The cream of asparagus soup was a bit thick and clearly sat out and was reheated (thick soup skin). 

Bread was cold too.   

Fettuccine bolognese was good looking; slightly oversauced. but again bad service ensued when he just shoved a fork into my plate. No 'excuse me'. Not putting it to the side. 

Another consequence of bad order taking is the wrong dishes were delivered to the wrong people.

Other mains are pork chop, beef brisket, florentine. All were average.

We had all finished and after a while we had to ask for our drinks. Another mark of poor service. No water refills at all. 

Service 0/5
Value for money 3/5

It is around $4.50 a slice of cake but the portion is not that big.  8"" meringue cake cost around $28 plus tax which is a little expensive."

The options, it appeared, were either a Japanese restaurant which the counter attendant at Bruno's said was not too bad, or Maxim. Well, we searched trusty Yelp and Maxim's was described as a Cafe serving French food. That was exactly what I was craving for and so we went in.

The lady asked me, in Cantonese, how many people and I was taken aback for a quick moment. I then realized this could be the same Maxims near my home...great for cakes, but so-so on everything else.

Service is awful here, in that it is very slow. They also do forget things. We came here Saturday around 3-ish so it wasn't prime time exactly. The food on the other hand was okay. I had the chicken which was covered in a great gravy, served with crunchy green beans (just the way I like them). My bf had the fish and chips which tasted like the best microwave oven fish ever! Crispy and crunchy on the outside, and fluffy white fish meat on the inside. The fries were yummy too!

Of course, we had the cakes for dessert and my fave is the Strawberry Meringue and Strawberry Shortcake:)

Overall though, I wouldn't recommend this place if you're hungry or if you're in a rush. The good thing is if you just want to be left alone and not have server's coming to see if your cup is empty or if you want more food, then this is your place.

They do serve alcohol (white and red wine) although there is no menu for it. Also, my bf originally wanted the kids menu fish and chips portion as he wasn't hungry, but they wouldn't accommodate which meant we got the regular serving (2 HUGE pieces of fried fish)."

It is an upscale casual bistro that happens to be run by Chinese.  And with this arrangement, Maxim offers exceptional value when compared to other casual fine dining establishments.  

Upon entry, I noticed the dim lighting, the white clothed tables, the pleasant and tasteful decoration and, you can't miss it, a wide selection of cakes in a refrigerated display case.

We ordered from the set dinner menu a Pickled Pork Hock with Sauerkraut and Potato ($19) and a Maxim's Mixed Grills ($22). Both came with roll and butter, starter soup, a piece of cake of your choice and a hot beverage. The Pork Hock was well portioned.  It was the size of a baseball (see pic). The flavour was bold, though not as complicated as the authentic pork hock at The Muskets. The meat was very juicy. The flavour was unfortunately one dimensional, but the tenderness and the juiciness of the meat made up for it. The Mixed Grills had a mix of steak, pork, sausage, and lamp chops (see pic). My BF said they chops were all tender and flavourful, though maybe salty for some. The cut of the meat was good.

I eagerly awaited the dessert because the cakes looked so pretty in the refrigerated display case.  There were maybe 10 types to choose from.  Patrons were expected to choose by viewing the case and ordered it through a wait staff back at table.  My BF chose a slice of Cappuccino Meringue and I chose a slice of Blueberry Almond Meringue.  I must say the Cappuccino Meringue was the better of the two.  

Is Maxim good? Yes, food tastes decent.  Is Maxim a good deal?  Oh 200% yes, if you order from the set menu.  The regular menu is rather pricey.  Is Maxim French?  I am not sure.  It tastes more continental to me.  The service was efficient and sufficient, yet definitely not refine by the standard of a casual fine dining restaurant.

Maxim is a solid choice if I feel like enjoying a Western meal in class but don't want to hurt my wallet too much."

They feature a wide variety of ""french style"" baked good and a pretty decent menu for dining. They bake a lot of cheese  cakes: lemon, NY, Mango, Mocha, Mixed Fruit, Green Tea, Chocolate Grand Marnier, and Strawberry.

The also have the standards: Saint Honore, Viennese Chocolate, Chestnut Cake (layered with imported chestnut puree), and a slew of differently flavoured meringue cakes.

This is the place to take your date or significant other for some deep soulful looks, as you contemplate the universe, or more prosaically, the next few hours to come. Just like Soma, (no sexism intended), it is more a 'chick's place' than a man's. I tried to propose there, it's that kind of place.

But if you have a sweet tooth give them a whirl. I am partial to the fruit flan and the hazelnut chocolate mousse."

I had to ask why. Then the agent said because I did not buy a full pound (that would have change my purchase amount if I would have known that). I then asked again if the espresso was a fine grind because it felt kinda rocky in the bag and I just wanted to confirm I was getting what I asked for (I have MS and I do not have a lot of feeling in my hands). I then left and went home and gave the espresso to my husband and he opened the bag and said this is a course grind. I was very disappointed. Their espresso is expensive and it was a gift.

When the TSA person pulled it off to go through it I stepped up and immediately saw the half empty bottle of water I threw in when I left for the airport that morning. I apologized and called myself a dope. The TSA person said no need , said I could drink the water and offered to throw it out. 

Nice crowd, friendly TSA agents and a great airport."

What a day. 

Unlike a lot of folks I encountered today, I'm a reasonable, calm lady. 

I'm not prone to lashing out or threatening harm upon a poor Southwest Customer Service Agent because God forbid the weather couldn't get me to my destination on time. 

Not being able to leave for Denver (I was scheduled to leave on SWA#1295, but cancelled at my client's request after several delays and him being unable to get on the road) because of the blizzard wasn't your fault. 

But I wanted to personally thank you for chipping a large part of the front of my night guard used for TMJ today (11/17). 

I rely on it to keep severe TMJ headaches and jaw pain at bay. 

One time my TMJ got so bad, it damn near completely locked my jaw and had to be prescribed heavy duty muscle relaxants just so 1) It could open and 2) So my dentist could see the damage.

This was a $300 dental appliance I've had for two years and had to pay 100% out of pocket because my insurance doesn't cover it.

In the future: When inspecting dental appliances in a passenger's bag, please handle with care. Night guards, retainers, etc. are NOT cheap to replace and aren't always covered by insurance. 

Seriously, break our make-up compacts all day. Just not the night guards!

Let's hope my dentist can help me with this. 

Signed, 

Nighttime Jaw Clencher Lady who's about to be in a LOT of pain. :'("

Coming in from Mexico I purchased 2 bottles of 3.4 ounces of vanilla not knowing I would be going thru TSA security again for my connecting flight home. I was told this was over the 3 oz limit and not able to go thru in my carry on. In my husbands bag there was an 8oz bottle of sunscreen, that passed security  just fine. When I questioned why his 8 oz bottle went thru just fine but my 3.4 was not both the TSA officer and the supervisor told me it was up to the agents discretion of what can pass and what can't. So then what's the point of having all these rules and regulations if it comes down to whomever lets whatever pass. An 8oz bottle of sunscreen vs 3.4 bottle of Mexican vanilla . Really !?!?! It feels like all this security is just a power struggle between officers and passengers instead of actually having a purpose of safety. 
BTW ..when I asked the original TSA agent about the option to check my bag she said it was a cost of $25, when the supervisor was talking to me he said a lot of times the airlines don't charge because they need the cabin space, however because I had already given up my item I could no longer get it back..so ya thanks for trying to make your wrong a right...but not really"

If you had clear viewable signs/website promoting your random weekly -if not daily security changes, so all passengers would not be caught off guard while going thru security. You may not have the passenger attitudes you create. I realize their are just stupid people who fly but the majority of the questionable stupidity and mind blowing self entitled, unreasonable attitudes center around and in TSA itself.

I entered into the security check point in plenty of time and selected the shortest line. The lines on each side seemed to flow seamlessly while my line moved at a snails pace. Just my luck. :) But that isn't my biggest concern. 

When it was my turn to scan personal items I put my shoes, belt, and jacket into one bin and rolled it toward the TSA agent who assisted it onto a conveyor belt. As I waited in line to get scanned I watched the TSA agent speak to the woman who was behind me. She had put her jacket, shoes, and personal items on top of her laptop. Instead of asking her to go get a second bin he took her personal items and put them in my bin on top of my belongings. 

At first I was just upset that her shoes were on top of my jacket but in hindsight its more alarming than being respectful of travelers personal items. It's not that I think the woman behind me is bad person but what if the she had a weapon, drugs or paraphernalia in her jacket? Would I have been held liable since her items were in my bin? Would the TSA agent of accepted his wrongdoing if it escalated into questioning or conflict?

I'm not impressed with this lack of professionalism and violation of protocol. This TSA agent had no issue questioning travelers and calling them out when they weren't following rules but who is holding him accountable for taking short-cuts?"

I was flying out of B, but the B gates security were closed. Nevermind that I had just walked down there from a restaurant in the middle.

I arrived to the A gates to a total nightmare scenario. TSA Precheck was closed, as they like to do here. I was lucky enough to be in first class for my flight, so I used that lane. There were a bunch of people in that line, so I asked if I was in the right place. The girl in front of me said a TSA agent just came through and ambiguously said this lane or the next one was for Precheck. What followed was a free-for-all with people using the disabled/employee lane and the first class lane. 

I called for a TSA agent to come over and explain which line was which, but they just looked me in the eye and listened to my explanation of how everyone was confused and nobody knew which line was with. Nobody from TSA was willing to come over and take control of the situation. They were just letting everyone in in whatever order they fought their way to the front.

I ended up getting yelled at and threatened by another passenger who mistook me as the enemy. I was just trying to get TSA to, you know, do their job. I'm the good guy here, sticking up for the 90% of the line that was getting cut by more aggressive passengers. 

Anyway, 15 minutes later I made it through security. Chatted with a supervisor who more or less admitted it was a terribly run checkpoint. Apparently this is normal in PHX, as an airport employee ensured me I was right, and the lounge agents shared their experiences with this TSA checkpoint.

It's really too bad this review will make absolutely no difference, just as me talking to a supervisor or filing a formal TSA complaint will. TSA will continue to do their absolute minimum to complete their job tasks without any pride for their work."

Terminal 4-A checkpoint is a huge checkpoint which, on Sunday, is pretty much at max capacity all day.

You offer PreCheck services and take payments at your airport. Then you have PreCheck locations at your security screening areas, but you decide to CLOSE them around 5pm for who knows what reason! Why would you deny that service, THAT WE PAY FOR, on a busy commuter travel day!? The past 2 weeks when I've approached T4-A I've seen no less than 200 people queued up in the regular line and at least HALF of those people when asked have TSA Pre on their boarding pass. Are you trying to save some money by not staffing that location? Well I'd didn't get a discount when I paid into this service.

Do everyone a favor. Staff this checkpoint just like you do T4-B and help out the people to weekly keep this airport's lights on and everyone employed.

So I normally tell them about my hip in the PreCheck line, so they send me over to another line with the body scanners, and my carry-on stays in the first line, but of course in those other lines you have to take off your shoes, coat, etc.  So I have to constantly tell them I'm PreCheck even if everyone else in line isn't, and of course they look at me like I'm an idiot. Why are you in this line if your PreCheck?

I guess nobody at TSA ever realized that MAYBE someone with PreCheck may actually have an artificial joint. I guess nobody ever figured that out.

Maybe TSA needs to all get together at a meeting, and figure out an organized way to handle EVERY type of passenger they might have. Then make sure EVERY TSA person knows this procedure."

I have tried a few of their group fitness classes  that are free for members. From my experience it  is excellent.  You are there to get a workout  and not worry about getting a socialization session in .  The best times to use the gym are between 2 am to 5 am, and 9pm-12 midnight. The one time you must avoid the gym is between  5 pm to 9 pm when the rush hour crowd comes.  You can get a good workout in  provided you are polite, assertive, and willing to share equipment. The rest of the  times  have a fair number of people like any other gym . 

THE GOOD
Automatic massage chairs, large variety of equipment, sauna, polite staff,  clean gym ( clean until people mess it up during the day), almost 24 hours availability: Opens on Mondays @ 6 om, stays 24 hours till Friday 9 pm,  On the Weekends It is 8 am -7pm

THE BAD 
Chest, biceps, arms machines, are always used during rush hour , not enough 25-45 lb dumbells to satisfy the demand of most people in the gym ,  the bikes are missing straps on the pedals, not enough air conditioning during the summer



If you know  why you are working out then this is the place for you to get  it  and enjoy the results.. If you are there to socialize, take selfies,lack social skills( you need them if you want to  work in on equipment,/get equipment)  then this is not the place  for you ."

1. Not enough equipments/machines. You have to wait in line to use a machine. Most machines are not functional because they are very old. I felt like I went back in time like 1997. 
2. Too busy doesn't matter what time you go. 
3. Too small. They have 3 squash courts yet they don't have enough weights or working machines...can't get my head wrap around this ^.^
4. You will find 50/50 ratio between clients and trainers. I have never seen that many trainers in any goodlife fitness.
5. It smells
6. Not clean
7. They lie (I am disappointed GL management). Why put a big sign saying 24 hours when you are not open 24 hours 7 days a week. It only pisses people off!

There is another GL in 1 km radius. This would be your best bet as there are no other gyms in the area. The west mall gym is nice but that is a good 10 min drive.

PS, I would rather go to my condo gym than this place."

Working out at other good life locations is convenient.

This location.  Like the other comments say, it isn't clean.  I have the worst sense of smell, seriously can't smell much.  But when I come in to here and it reeks of sweat, I know it has to be damn strong if I notice!!

When I signed up I went in to ask questions and mentioned I was going to purchase through a corporate account.  Corporate gives me half off the prices they pitch in store.   They wouldn't let up trying to get me to pay their price which was double mine, trying to tell me it was a better deal.  How was was double the price a better deal?

And like another reviewer stated, I wasn't interested in the personal training, which they seem to be coached pretty hard to push.  As soon as I made that clear, they didn't seem that interested in dealing with me any further.  I'm guessing the rate of commission for the employee that makes the sale for personal training must be quite lucrative.

Gym can be very crowded at times, sometimes ridiculously so.  On the other hand, I went one time at 4AM and there was no crowd!  However, during after work or early morning sometimes it's just too busy.

Perhaps if they reorganized the place so that, for example, the two bicep curl machines were side by side instead of upstairs and downstairs it might help alleviate the congestion.

I used to belong to ClubOne on North Service road.  ClubOne is more expensive than GoodLife, but like they say, you get what you pay for.

I go to two GoodLife locations.  This one is walkable, the other one I need to drive to get there.   All things being equal, I'll go to the other location when I have the chance."

First of all, it ain't 24-hrs...despite what the sign says.  And that's fine, just remove that portion of the sign and replace it with the hours of operation, so people don't feel duped.  Then again, who the hell would want to work out at 3 in the morning??!!  Not me!

After dropping in a coupla times for the week pass that I was so generously provided with by Shanty, here are my observations:

The Good:
-  it's a fairly large facility, but the layout is somewhat subterranean, spread over different levels due to the location in the mall
-  change rooms/washrooms are newer and kept clean
-  UNISEX!!!  I *need* and prefer this
-  they have a GoodLife propaganda channel and I thought this was motivational with their quotes on health and statistics on nutrition
-  they offer RMT services (for a fee, of course!)
-  PTs seemed fit
-  lotsa machines & tvs set-up
-  squash courts, if that's your thing
-  I think they offer childcare...although I never saw this happening while I was there
-  Spin room and class room seemed large enough
-  PTs, not really the workers (re:  people who are picking up weights or cleaning things) seemed genuinely happy

The N.I.
-  subterranean feel can also be a bad thing too, you hafta get used to the unique layout, there are quite a few hidden nooks 'n crannies
-  the club itself could use a facelift (some weird stains on the ceilings)
-  since it's a large club, at Square One, the members are a mix of retired folks, 20-30s, and punky kids who think it's cool to throw their water bottle across the room...'cause they don't want to carry it (??), juiceheads who drop their weights and  eggs each other on with grunts
-  weights weren't in the right place
-  I'd say that at least half their machines looked old
-  more than half of their tvs were fuzzy or just plain frozen

The location is pretty convenient if you lived nearby &/or like to shop!  ;)"

Being at square one, it is definitely a busy busy place. I would suggest going very early or midday to avoid the massive after-work crowds. 
This location has two floors and the upstairs is basically the same as downstairs except it's a bit smaller and has older machines. Still a good place to sneak away to if you find the bottom crowded. A lot of the classes are very busy so I would suggest arriving a few minutes early to avoid either not being able to get in, or having to position yourself in a very odd spot of the room to fit.
The instructors are great! All very enthusiastic, and able to keep you engaged the entire time. There has never been a time when I've been bored in a class. 

My biggest (and really the only) issue is that there are no kettle bells - only those that belong to the personal trainers. I get that they have risks associated with them if people don't know how to use them, but the same can be said for anything else. 

Otherwise, excellent place to get your workout in!"

I'm going to say something some may not like but if you don't have a clue on how to run a bar  (the greeks did it in the 70's no problem), why are you taking on the unknown.  I`ll leave it at that.  If you take a walk along the danny from donlands to coxwell you will notice all these crappy places sell beer and no food.  This is why places like Morgans avoid the domestic beer and charge large for food they don`t want any of the riff raff.

note: these are new owners the previous pete and jen sold.  they had great food and knew how to welcome u.  the new owner told me she owned a place at sherbourne and dundas...yucky pucky"

I've passed it a hundred times. Going inside it's nice enough. The paint is great. The place is clean. I was greeted by the bartender/waitress/karaoke host Lily dancing around and singing and yelling ""Happy St Patricks"". Sold immediately. Karaoke Friday and Saturday. Small beer selection on tap, but good enough. Six-ish dollars a pint. The locals were the friendliest I've encountered in Ontario. Walked in alone, walked out with three email addresses and many hugs. The kitchen is apparently open late but I wasn't hungry. Menu looked good. Mozza sticks. Burgers. Speghetti. Nachos. The usual.

The patrons are rude (one called my boyfriend an a**hole tonight after the karaoke host messed up his turn) and the new karaoke host is completely disorganized and lackluster - she takes more time cracking jokes and singing songs of her own than letting people sing and plays favourites with the patrons.

To be fair, because it was late in the evening, and I think it was my 11th or 12th pint, the memories are a little bit blurry. In a nutshell, I'd describe it as mostly harmless. 

It's one of those neighbourhood places that isn't interested in attracting attention or new clientele. The drinks were reasonably priced, the bar had plenty of TVs for those interested in catching the game and the service was pretty snappy, I think.

If you're looking for a cheap pint, a safe environment and potentially some live music or karaoke, Sportsters isn't a bad stop. Give it a chance."

Pricey, but not outrageous.

Food: We shared the pico de gallo, and I had a shrimp taco (although I'd ordered fish - see 'Service', below) and the mushroom burrito. 

We also shared the churro sundae and the fudge plate. Everything was very good - fresh, flavourful, satisfying, good portions, and not too heavy (except dessert, but hey, when you order a churro sundae you know what you're in for).

Drink: I had a cocktail, which was very nicely constructed; a good balance of sweet/dry. The beer selection looked good as well.

Atmosphere: we were outside on a sunny day on comfortable furniture - can't ask for more than that!

Service: Some of the issue can be chalked up to inexperience and understaffing, but a lot was a simple lack of polish and organization. I think the layout may also have contributed - pathways are a smidge tight and the bar seems to be a specific area of difficulty (although I usually expect to wait longer for a cocktail, the beer took even longer).

I want to be clear- everyone was very friendly, energetic and kind, which is the most important thing. However, all the staff seemed to lack important service basics - empty plates/glasses were left on the table throughout our meal; dishes went to the wrong table, or werethe wrong order; it took our neighbours 15 minutes to get water; servers were having what should have been private conversations about restaurant issues in front of diners, etc. etc.

I'm rooting for Chula, and I do recommend it! I just hope that the service issues can be sorted out before too long, and I can update this review :)"

Unfortunately, the lineup was out the door and so we did not get to sit on the patio (even after having made reservations prior). 

Appetizers were yum but small, so we wish we had ordered 2 of everything. We ordered the zucchini fritters, shrimp ceviche, and chorizo corn dog. Ceviche has quite the kick so those who are afraid of spice, beware.

Tacos were small and lacked flavour. We had ordered the spicy butterflied shrimp, pork shoulder, beer battered fish, and soft shell crab. To be honest, they all tasted the same - nothing made them unique or independently flavoured. We actually had to ask ourselves which one we ate after finishing. Also, not sure if we were just unlucky but the soft shell crab one was really fishy and smelled like the ocean.

Desserts, we tried all 3. Churros sundae was probably my favourite of the night!! Other 2 were nothing to rave about. 

Overall I'm glad I tried this place but I'd say it's overrated. I find the menu to be way overpriced for the quality and quantity of food. For $5-$7 a taco, La Carnita is a way better taco joint. I probably will not return."

I love the decor and the mural in the back is awesome! It really does feel like an authentic Mexican experience. Our server was so kind and came by many times to check up on us, and see if we needed anything. The food is decently priced and you get a fair amount. The waiting time wasn't long at all. I ordered the vegan option, so the mushroom tacos. It was satiating and delicious.

My husband and I came here for an early dinner, however it was so early that the place was dead, so we ended up getting the food to go. We'd definitely eat-in next time though, as the restaurant decor is awesome. 

We got the Perro de Maiz (Chorizo Corn dogs), the Carnita taco, the Cangrejo de Concha Blanda taco (Soft shell crab), the Seta Picante taco (Grilled spicy mushroom), and the Cola de Langosta taco (Whole rock lobster tail). The food surpassed my expectations! The soft shell crab seemed to be a bit over-breaded, and that is probably the only one I wouldn't get again. My favourites were the Chorizo Corn dogs and the Lobster taco. 

Even though we only got take out, everyone working there was super nice and friendly when we were waiting for our food at the bar.

This is a great place for families with small kids to visit.

They have a great menu and tons of vegetarian items. We tried the corn, zucchini tacos and fried avocado. 

The corn was excellent, their version of elotes. Definitely a must try. The zucchini tacos were yummy as it was crispy and has a good amount of salsa. The fried avocado was ok, was not a huge fan and was one small avocado for the price of $9. The prices were okay, but portion sizes were small. The chula beer was excellent and another must try. Also got a margarita with black salt! It was tasty and pretty.

Their beef taco was well seasoned, butterfly shrimp, and pork shoulder were all decent. We also had the corn as an appetizer and that was good too. The guacamole is the kind you'd make at home.

Cons -- The service and cocktails left much to be desired. Let's start with the cocktails. The bartender was sniffing the drinks rather than tasting them while making them. This resulted in a very limey cocktail (the El Rey and the Humo Grande). 

The service was patchy at best. We had to ask for hot sauce with our tacos (they were on some of the other tables) and even when the server brought them over, there was only one. 

Will I go again? Probably not."

Made no appointments as it was not busy when we arrived.  Called just in case to see if we needed to make an reservation but they said no need as it generally gets busy later in the evening, and they were right.  Once we sat there for a good 10 mins, we noticed people started to come in, one by one.  

Server were alright, it would be nice if  they described which taco was which, as we ordered 3 different tacos and could barely tell the difference.  

We got the churrizo corn dog as the appetizers, it was alright, kind of blend, the hint of spice was good.  The tomatoe/corn sauce on top was a good touch to compensate the blend taste.  

We got 3 tacos, pulled pork, chicken, brisket.  I would say i was dissapointed,  tasted a bit blend as well.  I had high hopes for the taco wrap as the pictures on yelp made it look delicious, but tasted kind of like card board and tasted tough.  And I've had my fair share of real good tasting tacos.  Compared to when i went to dominican/cuba before.  I had high hopes itll somewhat taste the same or more or less at least a different twist.

And finally for drinks we got the carribana and the sunrise cocktail, did not end up finishing it but they were pretty good if you like the super boozy taste.  The carribana cocktail you can taste the hint of coconut and was a good level of sweetness, same goes with the sunrise.  It had a good puch taste and nice touch of slush ice for a hot sunny day.

Would i go back, probably not for a while."

Well done. One of the biggest reasons I went. The other is a new spot on the east side of town which seemed kinda fun.

I have to say after reading what everyone else has said. I can't say I disagree. I had high hopes for the food. It fell short on flavour.  We didn't even finish our ceviche which  I always do because  it's a go to fave for me.

We were seated in the second floor dining area. Same level as the patio so I had to check it out. It looks amazing. Maybe in the summer. 

The service was sporadic. Present in the beginning but absent after the food was served. We waited forever for someone to come by to the point where we just flagged down another server to get our bill.

It's not a bad spot. It just had no standouts in terms of food. we ordered a variety of tacos to share too. The drinks - cocktails and beer - were okay. I'd say if they bumped up their food flavour game and worked a bit more on customer service this would be a solid spot.

A new Mexican place with a 2 tier outdoor patio?  Sounds pretty good to me!   

Definitey make reservations b/c as the new ""it"" place it gets PACKED.  We got a table for 2 outside on the first level patio.  The tables are tiny and squished together so you get to know your neighbours well.  In our case this was a good thing as we talked about the food with the couple beside us (who were just about to leave).

We ordered several tacos - a few each of the spicy mushroom, the shrimp and the chicken to share.  All in all they were ok but I felt they were lacking some acidity/zing to them.  They got a little soggy as well so a bit difficult to eat.  Nothing spectacular.  We also ordered the churros/ice cream on the advice of our table neighbours.  You can never go wrong with churros!  They were delicious but honestly it isn't hard to screw them up

I think the draw of this place is the outdoor patios.  On the first level, the middle of the restaurant has those lounge-y outdoor garden patio sets where you can sink back and relax with your drink.  Very nice place to chill - right by the tiki bar.  Yes they have a tiki bar.  It's all things kitsch with the décor.

2. We asked to be moved several times because the AC was blowing so hard and switching tables didn't help. Our waitress also told us that they need to keep the temperature down because they get hot running around serving customers... umm what? The place wasn't busy, she wasn't running around, and also how do other places keep a comfortable temperature?"

I wanted more, and I expected to come back. I'm surprised to read that some people were less enthused by their food.  It wasn't the best tacos I've ever head, but it was definitely above average, and I basically didn't have any complaints with the food.

The place was busy, noisy (because it was busy), there were a few mixups with the order and a server dropped a tray of drinks nearby, so it was a bit too chaotic. I hope that it will calm down a little and that the food consistency will settle in (since my food was great, and other people seem less enthused), and everyone will agree this is a nice place to go for drinks and food.

Give it a bit of time to find its rhythm, then give it a try."

Located in...I think its called East York.  They have 2 upper floors for patio seating.  Cool spot if you're not looking to go downtown.  Loved their variety on the menu.  We had a business luncheon and ordered a few different types if tacos, a salad, chips, pico de gallo and guac.  I really liked the guac.  Tacos were soggy and falling apart tho with the liquid sitting on the platter.  Unfortunately I didn't have any drinks as it was a work meeting.  Maybe next time! Definitely gonna check out the dinner scene before i decide on my final 3 star rating of the place. Street parking (not really my liking)"

The back patio is super cute and worth the trip alone, but their food is delicious to boot! Prices are very reasonable, and both the tacos and corn were just bursting with flavour (seriously, try the corn - you won't regret it). My only critiques are that the tortillas are quite thin and delicate, so it broke while eating and turned into a hot mess (a tasty hot mess), and that the menu is a bit small (no mole dishes, sadly).

Cheap drinks (try the $5 Chula Lager brewed by Wellington) and great apps - we had the chips & dips, zucchini fritters, shrimp ceviche, chorizo and crispy avocado and all were very tasty with terrifically flavourful sauces. 

Tacos were top notch - tortillas could have been a bit fresher but still kept together. Tried chicken, shrimp, beef and lobster. All great.

Some of the items are true winners.  The guacamole is first class, with the Cremoso Jalapeño cheese dip.

The tacos are also mostly good.  I could use a little more fish in the fish taco but all very tasty.
I had the Rock Lobster, Fish, Beef, Chicken were all excellent.

Fried Avocado was not a winner for me.

The sweets are also very good.  Citrus Margarita bars was my favorite, and the Churros were good but the dough is to soft and is hard to dip into the sauces without breaking apart.

Great local gem.  Looking forward to coming back."

We went in last night and were seated immediately. The server was really friendly, quick and professional. We wanted to try a few things, so we ended up with some fried cod tacos, tortillas and guac and the chorizo corndogs. 

Everything was frankly way better than I expected (remember that aforementioned skepticism?). The guac was fresh, chunky and really dynamic, not to mention clearly made in house. The accompanying chips were tasty and grease free, which was nice. The fish tacos were really good, a bit busier than I usually like. I found the fish to be slightly overcooked; but seeing as I tend to prefer my proteins slightly under I assume this is me being picky, and not an actual reflection of the kitchen. But the best thing was the chorizo corn dog. I'm almost tempted to go back tonight and get another one! We even got the churro sundae and it was delicious! But I'm glad I shared; it was very sweet and rich!

The room was nice, the bar was cool and the mural was really pretty. The only thing that underwhelmed was the bathroom -waaay too small and cramped! But if that's the worst thing I can say, there's really no complaints."

Went here thinking it's Mexican food so I should have a lot of options. Yeah, not so much. The items on their menu are not labelled with any gluten info so the waiter's suggestions were really helpful. 

All of the seemingly gluten-free options that are fried, such as tortilla chips and the cornmeal crusted calamari, are contaminated as they are fried in the same vat as the wheat flour fried items. The tortillas for the tacos are made from corn while the burrito ones are made with wheat. About half of the tacos offered are not gluten-free (3 are wheat flour battered), including the chirizo (normally a gluten-free standard) because it is marinated in beer. Noooo! I ended up going with the pollo tacos and they were delicious. For reference, I have a gluten sensitivity and minor cross contamination (few crumbs) doesn't bother me severely. I had no reactions with this place, but I also actively avoided eating the fried items that I knew would be cross contaminated. 

The reason I'm giving this place 4 stars instead of less for the minimal gluten-free options is because the wait staff are super helpful and try their best to work with your allergies. Also the ambiance of the place is fantastic, especially their back patio, which is a must for summer days. 

TL ;DR minimal GF options, great ambiance"

It was a nice night and we had a reservation so we were able to score a seat on the patio. Me and my husband ordered mixed drinks, a margarita and a ""Mexican sunrise"". Both were delicious, came cold and refreshing, the bar tender gave us a solid pour. We decided to order a bunch of different things just to try. We tried: the carnita tacos (3), the zucchini fritters, the chorizo corndogs, the brisket burrito, the shrimp ceviche and the chicken lollipops. There were no complaints  by anyone. Everything was very fresh, service was frequently and efficient. Dishes came out as they were ready (as indicated on the menu). The corndogs are a bit heavy, and fritters my favourite item, was a wee bit oily but nothing you can't get over. I ordered a sangria towards the middle of the meal and I didn't get it until we were almost finished. This meant I had to chug it before we could leave. It would not deter me from coming back however. The patio was quite congested, I think they have one too many chairs out there, but it's a good vibe so again no complaints. The tiki hut on the back patio is so cute, a very nice touch. Overall, a great new addition to the neighbour, any Mexican food lover will not be disappointed."

If you can get beyond the fact that what takes Starbucks one minute takes three here, you are in for a pleasant surprise.

The people who work here are exceptional. The employees and whoever had the foresight to hire them deserve a lot of credit. They are as quick as they can be given all the possibilities, and they are kind.

The tea is also great. Occasionally, some teas smell better than they taste (any tea with chocolate is this way for me). However, they definitely have something to suit your taste.

Located near Chipotle just north of Yonge-Dundas Square, this location is easy to find."

This is like any typical David's but it does seem wider than some I have been to. I was only there to get a cold tea and I was looking for whatever was ready. They had a strawberry and rhubarb or a black so I went with the black unsweetened. 

I like the fact that they have it ready as opposed to some Teavana that don't. I usually leave the tea buying to my wife but I like getting some once in a while whether it be a tin or bag. I prefer the black type while my wife likes milk oohlong. 

They have a deal going on now where if you buy a travel mug you can buy an iced tea for a dollar.

It was tarty, which is good for my preference. You can always ask them servers to add more sugar depending on your preference.

The huge selling point for this location was the wonderful attitude and service the employees provided for us. My friend spilled his drink literally a few seconds after grabbing it off the counter and the employees immediately apologized for our mistake. They did not have to but they even offered to clean the spill for us. My friend got another drink from the employees pretty quickly too.

I've worked at both teaopia which became teavana and grew up drinking Matcha green tea. I am a Ryerson student, and used to always grab a cup of tea before a long day of class. Today was the last time I am ever doing that. I went to this location on 10 Dundas Street E on Tuesday Feb 23rd at 2:30 PM, the lady who served me was really helpful and kind, however she kept sniffing her nose and rubbing her arm under her nose. I ignored it and moved on with my day. I walked out with my Matcha Soy latte to class. During class, after a couple of sips (about 6 sips later) I opened the lid of my drink, and i see a chunk of gooey substance on the rim of the cup, as well as stuck on the top of the lid. I cannot believe my eyes, and i feel absolutely sick to my stomach as to what i was just drinking from and what this is. I am more than positive that this is snott on the inside of the cup.

Nous optons pour les calmars frits en entrée, servis avec une mayonnaise maison, qui sont LES MEILLEURS que j'ai eu la chance de manger. Il s'agit de VRAIS morceaux de calmar enrobés d'une légère panure de style tempura. Aucun goût caoutchouteux, j'aime ça !

Of those things, they hit 2/3. Board games were a ton of fun and the selection was great. We spent about 5.5 hours there and actually made it within 15 minutes of closing at about 1:30am. The tea selection is also pretty extensive; some of the teas are also hand blended/mixed in-house and may take a bit longer to prepare. I had the Bazaar blend (hand mixed) and it was excellent. The right balance of a strong black tea with a unique mixture of spices including saffron that brought a nice twist. 

The downsides now. While the tea was good, the snacks were just okay. And we tried quite a few of them. Vegetarian curry, peppermint chocolate cake, boterkoek, hummus and salad and bowl of bits and bites (kind of like a trail mix). None of those were great and worth ordering again in my eyes. But it's good to have some snacks while indulging in the tea and games. 

Another downside was the service - VE-RY SLOW. It's a good thing the board games kept us distracted. Other than that, the seating is comfy and cafe is very Bohemian inspired. I thought it was a nice surprise to find out some of the art work on display can be purchased.

Often, I use the word when I do not know how to respond or to fill the gap (that may otherwise be a silent void). 

Bampot House of Tea & Board Games, I would say embodies the word ""interesting"". It is truly where people from different worlds collide. It feels like a mutli-verse - one corner of the room may have people jamming with guitar, the other  corner is filled with people enjoying board games, somewhere in a hidden corner is a person quietly working hard on their project. At times, you may overhear conversations related to overcoming limiting beliefs, provoking spiritual awakening or just waves after waves of laughter.

Even the password of the wifi is contemplative - ""maybe there is more to life, maybe not"".

The food at Bampot is earnest, poignant and hearty. There is something special about a bowl of hot soup, hearty stew or sincere curry to warm you up from the inside and out on a cold day. My soup of the day, Spicy beet with chickpea soup ($7.50) was full of warmth. It was accompanied by simple toast and coconut butter. Vegetarian rejoice.All the food served at Bampot are vegetarian friendly!

There are also endless selections of teas for every flavor profile. Different tea for different peeps! My favourite at Bampot is surprisingly not tea; it is the dark hot chocolate with housemade almond milk. It was the perfect soulful drink with a hint of sweetness. The white pot and cup with silver embossed lace even matches my OOTD (outfit of the day). It must mean we are meant to be! ;) 

Sitting in a small booth alone at Bampot, surrounded by rustic cushion with a warm bowl of soup and observing life is the wonderful way to spend a quiet evening."

When I walked in it was a lot dingier than I remember. We had initially sat on a table, and then moved to one of the cushioned alcoves by the window because it looked cozy. Unfortunately, they were very dusty and even had hair balls scattered around (one of them stuck onto my friend's shoe that she had taken off and placed off to the side). It looked like it hadn't been vacuumed in a long time. After noticing the hairballs we moved to a table nearby that looked like it hadn't even been wiped down. My friend asked the waitress if she'd be kind enough to bring a wet towel for her to clean it with (she didn't even ask her to do it) and she came back and brought us paper napkins. 

When the waitress came to get our order we asked whether ice teas were available. She told us that any tea could be made into ""iced tea"". Other than that she didn't have much knowledge about the teas since she was new. We ordered the dreamsicle iced tea, blueberry tea, and earl grey tea with a splash of milk. For food we got the savoury platter ($17.50) and a side salad. 

I'll start with the tea. It was all very watered down. I've ordered the dreamsicle every time I've been to Bampot and it's never tasted like that before. The teapot wasn't even filled to the top. The blueberry tea tasted like water. As an avid tea drinker, I'm aware that fruit teas usually have a lighter taste but this had very little taste to it. My friend's earl grey tea tasted like (her words) ""tim horton's tea that had been left to sit out cold"". We were so upset that we had contemplated leaving but unfortunately had to wait for the food. The tea cups and teapots were also all chipped and didn't look like they were in good shape. 

When the food finally came out, the platter was a sad imitation of a cheese/hummus plate. I looked at the pictures on yelp and mine didn't look anything like those ones, not to mention it didn't even have grapes. For something that's nearly $20 you'd think they'd be nice to include a bit more than a couple morning rounds cut up, hummus, crackers, cubes of cheese, and ¼ of a cucumber. 

The washroom also smelled strongly of urine and there was no paper towels. 

Sadly, I won't be coming back. I used to love Bampot but now it's just one those places that has been left to new employees who don't seem to care."

We both love tea and board games so it was the perfect combination. We went to check it out a couple of weeks after it opened. 

The environment of the cafe definitely suits the name. The cafe is decorated with yellow, orange, and dark red walls, reminding me of the Indian culture. There are some areas where you can sit in the nooks and crannies of the cafe with only pillows and drapes, giving off that bohemian vibe. The space gives a lot of intimacy compared to most places I have been to; which is nice and unique to Bampot. 

Bampot serves a vast selection of tea, some with free refills. Like most places, it has a $5 sitting fee if you would like to play the board games. However, it only costs $3 if you decide to order food. My boyfriend got the soup of the day, which was some sort of Thai curry soup the owners whipped up. He absolutely loved it and I enjoyed it as well. It had that spicy flavour that curry lovers would be familiar with. I had the Quangzhou Milk Oolong tea, which tasted exactly what you would expect a milk tea would taste like. It wasn't my favourite, but I didn't mind drinking it either. For each pot of tea you receive, you get a timer as well, so you know when the tea is perfectly steeped. Between my boyfriend and I, we pretty much drained all the hot water they had for our free refills haha.

There are currently about 160 games available and when I was there, many of them were unopened. My boyfriend was in heaven for a short period of time after I found a brand new Firefly board game towards the end of our stay. Unfortunately it was a two hour game and we were already there for about two to three hours. He sadly had to wave goodbye to it.

The cafe hosts different events here and now. They have Scrabble Night on Mondays and free knitting lessons often. They planned on having a Dungeons and Dragons game night as well. The owners said that they were looking for games to host events for. If you are a game enthusiast and would like to bring an event to Bampot, definitely reach out to them!

Overall, I highly recommend Bampot. It's so good that it's now my boyfriend's favourite board game place, knocking Snakes and Lattes to his second favourite. This is definitely a great date location to spend with your significant other. Also if you are a tea enthusiast, it is a must to visit! The cafe is very intimate and cozy with such a lovely staff. I don't recommend coming in with a large group of friends unless you are willing to break the group down. It's best to have no more than three (or at most four) other friends with you because of the space. The cafe also has hookah available as well."

I'm so happy that such a unique, comfortable tea place exists! They have something like 80 different teas on the menu, and the cutest little nooks with cushions to lounge on while you hang out and relax. Equally awesome place for a fun get-together or a comfy, quiet study session. Love it so much! :)"

The best word that comes to mind is cozy: this place is just so warm and cozy, and would be a great place to chill on a chilly fall or winter day. I came on a Sunday afternoon with a group of 4 other friends around 1 PM - it was pretty quiet when we first came in, but was a lot fuller when we left about 2 hours later. I love the decor in this place, there are so many colours and different pieces (carpets, curtains, tapestries, pillows) and it's so fun and eclectic, this place just has so much character. It is pretty accomodating for groups of various sizes, although I probably wouldn't come with a group larger than 5 or 6. We sat on some couches around a little coffee table, but it looked like most of the other seating areas were meant to fit groups of 2 or 3. I didn't actually look at the board game selection, but my group ended up playing one that I've never heard of before, so that was fun.

They have an extensive tea selection - I had the honey spice tea and it was kind of like a chai tea but a little bit sweeter and less cinnamon-y. I also had a salad and added a side of pita and hummus. The pita was so good, it was so thick and soft, and my only complaint here would be that there wasn't more. The salad was also pretty good, it had a lot of stuff in it like cashews and the vinagrette is house-made and very flavourful. Vegetarians will be happy to note that all the food options here are vegetarian and most are also vegan. My meal ended up being $18 after tax.

I can definitely see myself coming back here, even if it's just to chill and chat with some friends. I saw lots of small groups nestled in these little nooks all around the place, and some people had even brought knitting supplies with them. It looked so cozy!"

I was recently here for a birthday party and instantly fell in love with the place. The owners are young and run the shop themselves. I love the decorations. Especially the little reading nooks. I could spend days here. 

The specialty teas danced on my tongue. They're pricey, but they're delicious and unique. This is no starbucks."

When you first walk in, the restaurant asks you to please take off your shoes. Word of advice: It's a great idea to wear socks if you don't want to use the slippers provided by the restaurant and if you want to leave with clean feet.  I'm a bit of a germaphobe, so I wasn't too thrilled about taking off my shoes.

From afar, the restaurant looks small but once you are inside, you realize it is much bigger.  The venue has tons of seating and a bohemian-like ambiance. Bampot provides guests with little nooks where they can relax in a comfortable environment. The nooks have carpeting and pillows for you to just lounge. They also have some traditional table settings as well. The idea is to make you feel at home. 

The restaurant also has a room with shelving and tons of games available for play. We didn't play any games on this night but it was nice to know we had the option. 

The menu is also pretty awesome! Bampot can accommodate vegans and people who are gluten and/or lactose intolerant. Talk about a win!

I shared a vegan cheesecake with a friend and it was the best gluten and dairy free cheesecake I have ever had!  I would revisit Bampot just to have another slice of the blueberry cheesecake.  While there, I also tried the gluten and dairy free stew and falafels. Both dishes tasted amazing! I especially liked the falafels. 

Now onto the tea (the real reason we came here). Bampot has an extensive tea menu. They have tons of teas for you to choose from including some featured teas such as Unicorn Blood. It sounds disgusting but it is oh so amazing. My friend bought it and it was delicious. 

Later in the evening, I described the type of tea I was craving to the waitress and she created a tea blend that wasn't on the menu just for me. The tea tasted amazing and everyone in our group tried it and loved it as well. Of course, I had to ask the waitress what she did and she told me she blended strawberry kiwi and apple cider tea. This combination is so amazing, you'll have to try it!!

I highly recommend this restaurant café and believe you will love it too."

Was surprised the second I stepped in bc you can take your shoes off and wear slippers (apparently you can also keep your shoes on if it's summer). 

Someone in an alcove was singing along to her guitar when we arrived. It was magical. 

We were told that we could explore the space and make ourselves comfortable wherever we liked. The owner came by and spent quite a while telling us about how he prepared his Bam Bam Chai, his ice teas, how he got the idea for Bampot. 

The curry we ordered was delicious. It tasted quite wholesome. I was surprised by how good the iced green tea was. It had a light lychee flavour (?) which made the tea perfect for summer.

Bampot also has a selection of boardgames which you can play at 1 boardgame for $3 (if you order a main). 

The only downside here is the wait for food. It's definitely not the place to go to if you're in a rush. 

Overall, it has a really special ambiance. Would definitely recommend checking it out if you're into teas and relaxing spaces with a Bohemian vibe."

I wasn't a fan of this place as I wasn't feeling the vibe of it. I pictured a games room, but it's more of a lounging tea room (albeit, there are tons of games you could actually play here). Oh and you have to leave your shoes by the door. If you're into teas and zen like places, this is definitely the place for you. If you're anything like me, and are just looking for a snakes and lattes kind of atmosphere to play games in, don't come here."

Being at Bampot feels like spending an afternoon at your favourite Grandma's house. Order the sharing snack plate!

Came here on a rainy Saturday and this place could not be more perfect. It beats all the other board game cafes in the city. 

FOOD: We ordered the ballad salad, the shared snack plate and the homemade chai tea. I couldn't pick a favourite if you forced me. They have a huge, high quality tea menu and a good selection of foods and desserts.

Ballad Salad: garlicky, nutty, and fresh. It's a simple salad but the ginger garlic dressing is to die for. 

Sharing Plate: Nuts & Bolts, Cheese & Crackers, Hummus & Pita. All ingredients are high quality, fresh and simple. Very well done. 

Chai Tea: milky, spicy and sweet. Comes in a lovely clay pot and warms you up. 

ATMOSPHERE 
We sat on a raised platforms on pillows with our shoes off. Very unique, and great atmosphere for playing games. There are also regular tables if that's more your style. 

They have about 100+ board games and a large selection of books. We played Pandemic (the BEST 2 person game) & Mr. Jack."

Their game selection is okay, with lots of well known games, but nothing too out of the ordinary. 

Tea selection is amazing! Not your weird new age tea flavours, more of a subtle spin on classic teas (which I like a lot better than your new cotton candy, or birthday cake type flavours). 

The owners and super friendly too."

ATMOSPHERE - Outstanding atmosphere! So cozy and colourful, the Morrocan-themed and earthy-inspired decor is so well selected, with great attention to detail. There are a variety of seating options - from seated platforms, to the standard table & chairs, to armchairs and couches. 

TEA - They have more than 50 teas of all kinds of varieties - including specialty blends with hand-blended herbs and seasonings - which come by the pot at reasonable prices (which vary depending on the tea). Give yourself some time with the tea menu! It will tempt you in all different directions.

FOOD - Plenty of options to nosh on. Daily main, usually a curry, and a daily soup. Nice selection of both savoury and sweet snacks. All at decent prices. I had the best chocolate cake I've ever had! Check out the much-loved Bampot original: poutine soup!

GAMES - Good selection of board games! Nicely organized and categorized in the board game library.

- HOOKAHS - Tobacco-free shisha in many flavours!

My boyfriend and I went last night, because I had a craving for their pita and hummus (they put raisins and nuts of some sort in their pita, it's delicious). While we were waiting for our food, we decided that we would like a glass of water. 

Bampot has a tank of water at the front, and you serve yourself. Usually this works out great, but last night when we arrived, they were out of cups. So we asked our server if he could bring some out. He said sure thing... five minutes later, he still hadn't brought them out. We weren't asking for him to do anything particularly time-consuming, we just wanted a vessel to fill with water to drink. 

So we asked another employee (this took awhile, because employees are almost always at the back, not out where the customers are, so we had to wait for someone to come out). She said sure thing, she'd grab some right away... again, no cups. 

Finally, a third employee came out (she's actually one of the co-owners of the place) and we asked her for cups. She was able to provide, for which I was thankful. 

Nonetheless, getting a glass of water should not be a 25 minute process, and for that Bampot has lost a star."

They clearly view the place as a community-building hub. A couple of the staff are inconsistent and bring the cafe down, but please give Bampot another chance, if you happened to fall upon an aloof or surly employee.

I had the pita and hummus with a house salad and a decadent chocolate cake. They pay attention to detail even with their food!

Let's start off with approaching the place. I get that it's Harbord St. in Toronto, but really? It looks like a run down shack with a sign. Entering, you see some art; some is quite nice, and the idea to support young local artists is excellent, but do I REALLY need to see a FOUR ARMED WOMAN WITH HER ENTRAILS FALLING OUT OF HER while I eat and sip tea?! I think NOT! Absolutely TACKY décor from the 1950s, this place needs to be vacated and renovated with a nuclear weapon.

The tea: You would think that, being a teahouse and all, that they'd have a tea list on their website, but they don't. First strike. Second strike? The tea is frigid. The water is always lukewarm to ice cold. Third strike? It tastes gross. The fairy's blood tea (what a morbid name, gross!) tastes as though it was created by Paula Deen on psilocybins. It's like...liquid soap with some weeds from the garden, it's FOUL. And don't go ""teehee my tea is organic and has x, y, z as health benefits,"" because they do not. They're teas, not magic. They do not heal you or help anything but quench thirst, or scald a tongue. In this case, they ruin your day.

The food: while some of it does indeed appear nice, their menu is really all over the place! You don't go from ""poutine soup"" (Yes, it's as disgusting as it sounds. It's watery gravy with half-baked potatoes, and stringy white cheese), to baklava and sahlep! Speaking of which, REALLY? If you're going to serve food from another culture, it better be spot-on, otherwise this is just some wannabe crap that's insulting. Unfortunately, it falls into the latter category, and it's offensive. You sahlep should not be dirty dishwater, and your baklava should not be some frozen, store-bought nonsense! Unacceptable! And RESELLING CHEERIOS? CHEERIOS? GET OUT! OUT, OUT, OUT!

Removing shoes at the door sounds cute in retrospect, but quite frankly, I don't want to smell other people's nasty shoes! 

Service was rude, and the workers only talked to white people like myself. The Arab girls in the place were completely ignored, despite being paying customers. This place is honestly like a gentrification cafe, it's just disappointing.

The store's house should read ""MONDAY THROUGH SUNDAY: CLOSED!"""

I had walked by this place so many times, vaguely curious but never venturing in. I'm so glad I did. It's like walking into Narnia, skylights and cozy nooks built out of pillows and lovely wood, plants everywhere. Huge tea menu, $5 + seems pricey for a cup of tea at first, but they're actually served in beautiful hand made pots that keep the tea at a perfect hot temperature with enough to sit and sip for a couple of hours. I never partook in the food or the board games while I was there ( though I appreciate that there isn't a cover for anyone who walks in like some games cafes. They only charge if you decide to play) but the food menu looked great and I'm excited to go back and sample it. Thanks for creating an oasis in the annex guys, I'll be back soon!"

Bampot's selection of board games is like it's selection of teas: vast and awesome.

They have their board games split up into sections (strategy, casual, etc.), and in your menu will come a sheet with the board games listed into sections, with the average playtime per game listed, too. Since Bampot is brand new, the board games are too! I broke open seasons to find that the game hadn't been played yet since the cards were still in their packages! No ratty old board games here!

The cover fee to play board games is $5 if you don't eat, $3 if you do.

There are, I believe, over 70 different teas you can try here. I'm not a big tea person, but I sipped some of my friends teas (apple mint, and faerie's blood), and they were both delicious (especially the faerie's blood, which is steeped with not only the tea but fresh fruit also.) Many of the teas also have free refills :)

They have a non-tea menu for people like myself, with items like Maple Milk & Hot Chocolate. I paid about $3 for not just a cup but a POT of DELICIOUS hot chocolate - some pretty great value there.

The food kicks some serious butt too. I gorged on Poutine SOUP (yep, it IS as amazing as it sounds), Chocolate Strawberry Cake (chocolatety, decadent, delicious), and a yummy yummy ""posh"" cheese board.

The staff are extremely nice, they are happy to chat, help you wade through the giant tea menu, provide both tea and board game reccomendations, and more.

The decor is also cozy and adorable. It gives off the feeling of playing board games and/or enjoying some tea in a friend's living room.

There is also shisha available, a Monday Night Craft Circle, and other events in the works.

I can't wait to come back. I will definitely be returning. What a gem!"

Heartache of heartaches, THEY HAVE CHANGED THEIR FALAFEL recipe. Their old-school falafel patty, which was basically an angel sent from heaven in chickpea patty form is now a less flavorful, balled, ugly stepsister version of the original. Makes my soul cry :'( It's still alright, but I long for the days of yore when the Scottish owner chef-guy made them from scratch.

REST IN POWER FALAFEL PATTY.

Still love the place as always. They've got a rotation of new lovely servers and service has gone up just enough for me to not find any issues. Yes, it's still a little slow at times, but I was there for over 3 hours sipping away and studying and I was impressed that I was checked up on a few times (huge difference from before.) The one server who had given me a touch of attitude is now gone and it's softened the vibe visibly. 

It was really lively on the Sunday afternoon I visited, a huge ASL group took up the front space signing away with vigor, to the right of me, a nuclear family quietly enjoyed tea, while university students kept the back jumping.

I live down the road from here and basically use Bampot as my second home."

Very chill atmosphere and the moroccon mint tea I had was lovely. They have an extensive tea list so there is sure to be something for everyone. My date had a salad which he said was fine and I had the daily curry which was a lentil sweet potato curry. The curry was decent but the pita that it came with was the star for me, it was chewy with raisins that was a sweet contrast to the curry. Overall, I really liked the atmosphere and after 9ish it started getting quite packed. I would definitely come back for a visit!"

I also love the Ballad Salad, the falafels, and their delicious raisin pita! The specials are usually great, but the one time I didn't like it, they took it back and didn't charge me for it.

The board game selection is really great and often the management will come back and check out what we're playing and see how we like it. 

The only downside is the service can be pretty hit or miss. I'm not sure if this is because we normally sit in the back, but we often have to hunt someone down to make an order and sometimes the we'll get a dessert before our main! haha.

It is all vegetarian, with GF and vegan options, and some items can be made GF and/or vegan as well. Game selection is great too. It's also a great place to read/knit/smoke shisha as well, and it's very cozy.

Great customer service. The place is owned by a Scot man who wears his kilt proudly. When I came in the place on a Tuesday night, it was full. Understandable as it's a unique tea house. I can see why people come there just to read and hang. I'll probably not be returning though as the quality and tea making technique was not very high. Whether one chooses a Chinese, Indian or Russian tea etc, it's all brewed in a largish pot and served in a bowl cup. Blasphemy!

I've been to Bampot 7 or 8 times now, and the service is consistently slow, aloof, and is dangerously bordering on bad. The most notable offences have been delivering tea with a TEN MINUTE delay to getting cups (with no staff to be found the entire time) and the incomprehensible water policy. Bampot staff won't get you water (in fact, they flat out refuse), and direct you instead to a water pitcher and glasses by the front desk. While this is okay in theory, it becomes a disaster in practice because the pitcher is always empty or there are no cups available. Mix this with the staff's propensity to disappear, and you're looking at long wait times to get water. If they want to continue this help yourself to water policy, they need a bigger pitcher or cooler and they need to be diligent about replacing cups. Aside from these two main problems, the staff do nothing to make you feel welcome and are actually quite rude. The food is also quite bad (e.g., poutine soup is waaaaay too salty), although the carrot cake and bits and bites are excellent. I wish they could get their service and food act together, because the potential here is high. Board games and tea selection are still great."

Was a bit taken back at the fact you have to take your shoes off at this place. 
Interesting atmosphere, people bringing their own instruments to play or maybe were they there from the place for people to use, Im not sure. Little cubby hole seatings, a seat for one or larger groups, places by the window that have no seating just a raised platform with rugs to sit on with low tables for your food. Note books for people to randomly leave their mark and for you to read or view the art left by others. The crowd I would describe was quite ""earthy"". Almost like walking into a different zone all together. 
However, once I got over that and had their healthy food. Oh it was pretty tasty. Looked and was pretty simple meals but surprisingly there was some goood flavor in it too! And to know you are eating healthy - well done Bampot! Had the hummus and salad. But the pitas almost tasted like they were home made (maybe they were I didnt ask) and the salad dressing?! I asked what was in it but really they should just bottle that up and sell it. 
The tea I chose was a miss sorry to say. I think it was a chai base and apple or something I forget (was a month ago). My friend's mango one apparently was very tasty!
Only thing, the tea did not seem too hot when it came out.
The waitress got some things off, as my friend had to wait exceptionally long for her poutine soup - which they got mixed up with another dish and only told us until we questioned the long wait (my other friends were hungry and already almost finished their meal before my other friend got hers) and by that time she just changed it to the carrot soup which was already available. 
You do have to be open minded about the eclectic earthy hippy atmosphere and who ever you bring should be like that too. 
Well I am not much of a bohemian, the service is questionable at times, but Im interested in teas and healthy food that tastes good!"

In all my years of reviewing, this takes the cake as one of the worst places I've been to. 

PROS:
+SEATING: Comfy, somewhat spacious. The have little seating areas with pillows that look really comfortable to play board games in.

CONS: 
- FOOD: My spicy peanut soup was neither spicy nor soup-y. It was basically rice with vegetables and some peanut sauce drenched on the rice. So disappointing. I also didn't order a salad, but was happy because I thought it came with my $9 meal. I learned afterwards that they made a mistake which I realized at the cashier. Reluctantly, the cashier took the salad charge off my bill but she made the most horrendous gestures. 

She slammed the interact machine in my face and ultimately did not look pleased. Even if she wasn't being the best cashier, there's something called BASIC HUMAN FUCKING DECENCY. So rude. 

The food selection is both limiting and ultimately disappointing. The pita bread was yummy though, and sweet, but not worth $9 as part of any entree set. Looking at my friends' meals all around, nothing truly appealed to me. 

Ultimately, I recommend Bampot if you're a tea connoisseur. If not, go somewhere else where your consumerism is more valued."

I've yet to try their Baklava. Their vegan cheesecake is superb. However, you don't go to Bampot to eat. You go there to enjoy one of their myriad of teas.

TEAS: Bampot offers some of the best selection of teas in the GTA IMHO. My all-time favourite is the Desi Chai (Indian Masala Chai). It's creamy and flavourful. A pot for one person was enough for 3-4 cups. I was impressed. Whatever kind of tea you like, you will find it at Bampot.

SERVICE: The service was courteous and friendly. Your waiter will be happy to advise you on the best tea according to your preferences.

AMBIANCE: This place is not your typical cosmopolitan, hipster-ish tea house. It feels more hippy-ish, more relaxed, more communal, than commercial. It's a gathering spot for all kinds of people who come to Bampot to have a good time. Bampot is not for those seeking the next ""hot"" coffee / tea house in the neighbourhood. It's for those who want to enjoy a cup of good tea and have a relaxed conversation with their friend or partner.

I used to be this place's biggest fan, always raving about it my friends (and even strangers!) but today I was really disappointed and I don't think I'll be going again.

A friend and I came in today and we were surprised by a giant hanging shoe rack-- while fine in theory, people's feet smell, and having several stacked up right by the door was not a great idea considering the place is already narrow. I also noticed that there was a significant lack of lighting, and artwork.

We weren't even given any menus, but were told to grab a couple ourselves from a basket. That was really strange since normally you're given one as soon as you're seated, but I was willing to look past it. The new menus are very hard to go through, so I stuck to the old menu that's been around for years, and picked out a tea. One of the employees suggested something else, and after we agreed to try it, he went off to the back and sang while he made us our tea. It took him a long time to get back to us, passing back and forth while chatting to others, letting us know that he'd be ""several minutes."" We didn't get our order taken til 15 minutes after sitting down, but we did get our tea quickly once he had a minute. The weird thing is, though, that one of the owners was there, and he was just lounging around.

The tables were sticky, but the employee who sat us down ran off to grab some napkins to clean up. After we got our drinks, we felt like we were unwelcome. The owner didn't even acknowledge us but literally took the time to greet everyone else who walked in. We were also ignored for the entire time we were there, so we ended up deciding to cut our visit short and just pay for the one pot of tea. We left without anyone acknowledging us (after paying), and both my friend and I felt really uncomfortable and like people were being hostile towards us.

We did notice the demographic changed a lot from when we would go in-- there didn't actually seem to be very many people in, but the people who were in were performers for the event happening later on that evening. I always went to Bampot for the atmosphere and the people, but now it seems like those have deteriorated as well. The food was never that great (though I've always loved their sahleb), the service is dangerously close to bad, there seems to be a newly developed hostility to people who don't fit the Bampot ""type,"" and the new seating is really uncomfortable and cramped in the back. The tea is very good, and it always has been, but it wouldn't be hard to find another place to pop in to.

I really hope they get their shit together, I loved this place in the past and it's just so sad seeing what it's become now."

Average service and experience (not unhappy, but not overly impressed).  I was sitting in a chair next to a young woman who frequently uses the salon, and she was quite happy with the services.  It was nice meeting her and listening to them visit with her.  I assume this means their service is good enough to have repeat customers and know their history.

My nails were not painted, he never communicated that he was moving, nor that someone else would finish me up, despite also being there for a manicure as well. 90 minutes after walking in, my nails still were not painted, nor a manicure started.

I'm 23 and really into the newer, more modern styles and every other person that I had gone to previously always claimed that they could do marble style or ombre nails but it came out looking terrible and not what I asked for. John keeps himself educated on pretty much everything and takes a lot of pride in his work, which I admire greatly. He has always taken his time with me and made sure I walked out of there happy. He did an amazing job doing different designs, ombre styles, and my new fav, the marble look. He's also very good at sculpting your nail shape to whatever you desire.

However, I got annoyed the last few times because I'd have someone working on my mani or pedi and then they would leave in the middle to work on someone else. I started going to a new salon mainly because of this reason.
However I went with my friends today because it was basically the only place open. I walked in and was asked what I needed. I said a gel mani. I sat with my friend for about 20 mins and then we were seated at a nail area. The man started to process to take off our gel polish. We sat there for 25 mins and then he moved us to the other side so we could sit with our other friend, which was kind of him.
However we waited at least another 25 mins. I finally took the foil off because it was driving me nuts.
A lady started taking off my polish finally but was a bit rough. She ended up cutting the cuticle by my thumb.
The man then came back (no clue where the lady went) when I said something to my friend about leaving since I had already been gone for over an hr and a half, and still have no polish.
The guy told me one minute...and he would come do my manicure.
He came over and was obviously rushing (they were very busy and only 3 of them were working). He was also very rough and used his nails along the side of my fingers to get rid of any polish. Which didn't work. The skin of my fingers was stuck to my nails.

He then left after he put the Polish on. I waited another 5 mins expecting the massage part...nothing. finally I said ok I'm going to go.
He said oh you want lotion? I said no.  Never mind it's fine.

I was then charged 35 dollars for a half manicure that took over 2 hours and wasn't even completed.

He did apologize for the wait but I feel like we should have been told there was going to be a wait. To be honest I probably wouldn't have waited and would have held out for classy nails to open on monday.

There is a reason I stopped going to bubbly nails. If you don't mind having 3 different people work on you and have them run between you and 6 other people then this is the place for you. If you like to have a dedicated person who takes their time and does an excellent job and is honest to you about wait times, AND costs less...go to classy nails by the sun city harris teeter. They are awesome."

It's a family owned bar that draws in a great crowd which ranges from all ages and professions. The food is always delicious, the prices are very reasonable, and there is plenty of parking.

If you haven't been there before let me save you the trouble of finding your way into the place. The front of the bar faces the main road but the front door doesn't open, you have to enter from the side of the building.

One thing you'll notice is that it's a small building. The bar can fill up quickly around happy hour, however I've always been able to find a seat, plus they have plenty of tables to accommodate a large crowd. They have a nice patio on the side of the building which includes a roof top for when it rains, outdoor TV's so you can have a smoke and not miss the game, and heaters for winter time.

I don't believe they are open earlier in the day, so count out stopping here for lunch. 

Overall it's a very nice bar! Let me rephrase that, it's a nice PUB! What's the difference? A bar is a place you go to drink, but a pub provides a social atmosphere that makes each visit fun. I recommend coming here if you're looking have a couple beers with a friend after work, or if you'd like to catch an Indians game."

There was ample parking in the back, and there were plenty of cars there, so we figured it must be decent if there was a crowd on a weeknight. 

It isn't a huge place, but the bar is pretty big and it looked like a great place to watch a game. The bartender Sam introduced himself to us and was very friendly and helpful. The walls are covered in sports memorabilia and bar signs. It's a very local ""dive"" style bar, but in a good way. Everything was super clean. 

They had $1.50 domestics, and the tall draughts were $3.50. They give you a brand new iced mug with every beer, which makes such a big difference. 

Their food menu is pub fare, and the prices are incredibly reasonable. We got their $2 burger special. It was a quarter pounder and came on a nice bun that was slightly toasted and had lettuce onion and pickles, cheese was an extra .30 cents. The sauerkraut balls were tasty as well. 

I was checking out some of the other food items that people sitting near us at the bar were getting and everything looked really good. The bartender Sam said they're known for their wings, I'll definitely be back to try them soon."

The home and pool were built in 1999 so some things needed work. The pool equipment had not been well maintained. We had Keith replace some pop-up heads that didn't, unclog the main drain that was full of plant debris, and replace the sand filter--it was showing its age and the sand appeared to have never been replaced. He had to replumb the system around the pump and filter because of poorly completed initial installation. Later, when the old pump was dying, he replaced it with a new multi speed, programmable one that uses considerably less electricity. I use his monthly pool service as well. All the work he has done has been reasonably priced and professionally completed. I highly recommend him for pool repairs and monthly service."

I'm not too crazy about the case goods, typical painted veneer over particle board square boxes that to me belong in an office not a bedroom.

I recently just had my wedding on August 28, 2010...she was hired as my caterer and we had a contract.   We paid a great amount of money for her to cater for 140 people and she was all paid up one month prior to my wedding.  Not only did we put trust into her being our caterer, we also turned to her for planner help. We first met with DeeDee Maza with Ciao Baby Catering and we thought she was so passionate about making couples happy and being the perfect caterer.  Little did we know that was not the case.  We had a contract with her and had tastings with what she was going to provide for our wedding and on the wedding day there were a handful of things that went wrong and many of the things that were listed in our contract were not reached.  We paid her a great deal of money up front- Always on time and we definitely we think we overpaid for the service we got.  First, the main thing was that we paid a lot of money for her to cater, we paid for 140 people and there was actually about 125 people that actually came.  She ran out of food and did not have enough for 125 People.  We have multiple counts of people coming up to us after the wedding and said they did not eat or their food was cold (turns out that the burners for the pasta station she was providing ran out of gas).  We have come across our guests stating that they saw DeeDee (owner) yelling at the server carving the meat at the meat station that he was slicing the meat too thick.  There was suppose to be 4 prime ribs to be sliced and there was only 1 for the whole evening.  We got done eating at our sweetheart table and saw that the pasta station was taking quite a long time.  Lance and I understood but the line was wrapped around the room, so we decided to make our rounds to say hi to every table.  After an hour and 15 minutes we returned to our table and we still had our plates sitting on the table.  We then looked around and had to ask a server to take away our dishes.  And we had to do that multiple times throughout the night.  That was a service that should have been done by the caterer.  She said that she was out monitoring the event throughout the night which was not the case.  She came up to me half way through our reception stating that she was going to leave.  These are just a few issues I'm bringing up...but there are a handful more. 

Not only was the catering bad, I had my trust in her.  So when I was overwhelmed in my planning process I turned to her to see if she had anyone that had experience in planning.  And she said she had just the person that had plenty of experience.  I was so excited to receive the help and introduced me to Tracy.  We had to sign a contract and in that contract we paid her $1000.00 to organize the wedding day and a long list of duties she was to perform.  About 3 months before the wedding I explained to DeeDee that i wasn't sure if I was even working with Tracy, she never contacted me to help plan anything.  We had a couple of meetings with Tracy and DeeDee but other than that nothing was productive.  1 month before the wedding she brought in this girl name Autumn taking the place of Tracy.  She showed up for the rehearsal and the day of the event.  But instead of her doing the tasks that were provided in the contract, my sisters' who were in my wedding party were running around doing the tasks she was supposed to be doing.  There was nothing in the contract that she completed.  To me that is breaking our contract.

So my husband and I tried to resolve the situation.  We didn't want to ever ruin DeeDee Maza or Ciao Baby's Reputation but we felt that we did not get acceptable service and we overpaid for what was promised.  So we called a meeting and she confirmed.  We went to meet her and she couldn't make it so we had a phone conversation.  She got defensive and denied everything.  She didn't want to make us as clients happy or reconcile the problem.  We felt that we should be refunded the $1000.00 for the planner that did not meet any of the contract agreement, and half of what we paid for the catering services which Ciao Baby did not provide the service, food, and professionalism we were guaranteed.  At this point we just want other couples to know about our negative experience Ciao Baby Catering put us through, and hopefully other couples don't experience that.  Planning a wedding is so expensive as it is and people paying good money should not be scammed.  

From my personal experience, I WOULD NOT use her services again.  Ciao Baby Catering and Dee Dee Maza also has NEGATIVE REVIEWS with the Stone house.  She was head caterer there and other reviews from that venue, were not good either.  Dee Dee is planning to open up her own venue in Tempe, AZ and cater there.... with the services I got for my wedding I would never go near that place."

Let me start off with the basics...FOOD - AMAZING. I was looking for a caterer who could handle gluten free (I have celiac) without making me pay double. Well, she was able to make our entire meal gluten free. Everything at our wedding was an option for me! We interviewed close to 15 caterers and hired Ciao Baby. It was the best decision. I have had several people contact me asking for their information because the food was that great. We did three tastings. I remember thinking that I Hope the food was just as good in mass quantity and it was. Every raved. One of the band members even said the sauce was so good that he wanted to bottle it and make it into a shake. Nick and Dee Dee are a great team and the food was to die for. I am a picky eater especially because of my gluten problems but they wowed me and all 175 guests (and we had picky people). 

Service - Excellent. We were having a backyard reception and Dee Dee came to the house three times to make sure everything was going to be fine. She even dealt with an electrical issue for the rentals company just to be helpful. Her staff made sure that we were taken care of at all times. Originally, we had discussed one menu idea and she wanted to understand our vision and said...""Why?"" Thank God she did because she made us think through our idea and our reception was far better because of her working with us to make sure things flowed naturally. 

Presentation - The plates looked beautiful. The appetizers were passed and there were plenty to go around. 

Price - Completely reasonable. We were getting quotes for 1.5 times to 2 times more than Dee Dee and then not getting nearly as much. She cooks all the food on-site - that's right nothing sits in a chafing dish while they drive. Dee Dee allowed us to really think through our menu. Nick was able to guide us with different ideas and talk about seasons and our theme so that everything tied together beautifully. 

My dad is the pickiest man I know. He could not marveling at how good the food was. Truthfully, I think Ciao Baby Catering made our wedding a success. I am blessed to have found the whole crew. The servers were kind, polite, diligent, helpful and hard working. 

The bartender even ""named"" a drink after my nieces so all night long they had a special drink to order. 

Dee Dee told us early on that she wanted us to know that our day was going to be the best ever and that she would give her all. Nick and Dee Dee proved that they give 125% and so does their whole crew. 

I expect a lot when it comes to customer service and everyone at Ciao Baby exceeded my expectations. Dee Dee and Nick, you guys have my heart. I will see you soon because I miss your food already. 

I highly recommend Ciao Baby. You can't go wrong. You'll be delighted by their skill, commitment and kindness."

I hired them for a very large event and they showed up with half of the food missing and kept trying to keep me away from the buffet stations so I couldn't see what was missing. When I realized what they had done and tried dealing with them the next day, they fabricated a story about supposed menu changes and went so far as to forge my signature.

It was really a fun spot we had a great time the regulars were friendly and we felt quite comfortable here. I did order the pork belly ramen to go and it was a little salty but the porkbelly was so good. We will definitely be back to play Some games and the jukebox.
Nice experience with this spot."

A late kitchen for other industry workers is always a huge plus. The bar was busy, but my friend and I opted for a table, instead. A server came over right away to give us water and to greet us, but to also let us know that any orders we make, had to be made through the bar, which was fine and we understood because my friend and I are both servers and bartenders. We did not try any of the beers or cocktails.

My friend ordered the pork belly skewers, which he thought were great, and he also ordered ramen as an entree, which he told me was just okay. 

Having moved to Cleveland from Florida, I was very excited to see ceviche bowls offered on the menu for the spring and summer. I ordered the California ceviche bowl, which comes with white rice, avocado, scallions, tilapia, corn, and tomato salsa. I knew I was ordering cold fish and salsa with warm rice, but it just didn't meld well as expected and like other hot/cold combinations I had tried in the past. The rice seemed to have been sitting out for a while because it seemed to have gotten hard and crunchy. I didn't taste anything really stereotypically ""ceviche"" about the fish... no taste of lime or any citrus or any use of peppers, but I'll give it a pass because I still thought it tasted okay. 

What I had the biggest issue with, however, was the tomato salsa they used. It straight up tasted like marinara sauce poured over rice. I get that it was not listed as a spicy dish, but even a mild salsa has more taste than a standard marinara sauce. I looked longingly at the sriracha on the table and thought this dish would have tasted so much better omitting the tomato salsa and replacing it with sriracha, but alas, the damage was done.  

Overall, I'd come back to this place for the cocktails and to enjoy the very awesome atmosphere at the bar, but I don't think I'll be trying their food again."

We're so happy it took the place of Bonnie & Clyde's--which was smelly, dark, and overall not a place I ever wanted to be unless I was inebriated already. But Yuzu is a completely different vibe. 

Lots of seating, both bar space and a dining room, nice lighting (not too dark), and the music was at the perfect volume (perfect for having conversations without having to yell). Basically, it's a great place to come have a few drinks and sit and talk with friends. Definitely not the kind of bar to get wasted at (checkout the bar next door for that).  

As for the drinks, Yuzu really gets it right! The cocktail menu is extensive and we had a really hard time deciding what to try. We ended up going with 3 am Snap Stories, Florida Georgia Lime, and Gojira. Totally recommend all of them, but my favorite was 3 am Snap Stories. It's a tropical drink and perfect for summer. Everything was priced really well, not too expensive for craft cocktails. 

Didn't try any food but we plan to go back and change that. Someone next to us got the fries which looked and smelled so good. And everything else we saw coming out of the kitchen looked and smelled good as well. 

The bar staff was really friendly and very attentive. They were really helpful when we had questions about the drinks. Our favorite bartender from B&C's was there serving too, which was cool. 

If you're looking for a place in Lakewood to have some good food, drinks, and chill with friends then definitely check out Yuzu!"

Their menu is quirky and you can't necessarily pinpoint what kind of cuisine it is, but that's what makes it so interesting! The only quip I'd have is that they seem under-staffed, albeit with extremely friendly waiters/waitresses.

Also, I know they have items on the menu for dogs, but to be sitting inside and someone walks their dog through well to me that is not cool in a restaurant.

We ordered a beer and the bartender was doing double duty waiting on tables outside.  After about 15 they took our food order.  

The wait time wasn't horrible but it could of been better.  I had the Bourbon Chicken which was good and my husband had the Ramen something or other.  His looked like soup and had a skewer of beef.  I tried it and it was just OK.  He left hungry and we ordered a pizza on the way home.

I remember coming here and being greeted warmly by the staff. However, this time was different. I sat at the bar as I usually do and was given a menu and water right away. When the bartender/server came over to me, I wasn't quite ready with my food order. I ordered a drink and app in the meantime. It was the birthday shots and carrot parsnips fries. After getting my drink, she left to attend another patron. 

This is when the visit started going downhill. The bartender/server came by about every 5 min to ask if I wanted to put an order in and as soon as I could answer, she would be gone. Now, I have been a server/bartender and even on the busiest of nights I, at least, attended to my tables that haven't ordered yet! Still haven't received my app. Finally get to order because the same guy who got me water and a menu thought I looked like I needed help. Fast forward to when the food comes out. It's lukewarm and the rice in the rice bowl I ordered was literally crunchy. The pork belly skewer deserves 5 stars and is the only part of my visit that reminded me of what I loved about this place. 

I used to love this place. Grilled meat on a stick with fantastic cocktails, fabulous beer list, and service staff with personality! What's not to love? But unfortunately, it seems that things have changed. I'm seriously debating coming back, but the pork belly skewer is calling my name."

The staff was super friendly and attentive. The drink menu is hilarious. I got the Blueberry Yum Yum & my husband got the ""Thrift Store"" - a bottle of beer served in a brown bag with a shot of the bartender's choice. The whole experience was fun. As we were waiting for our food we played checkers (they have a corner with a bunch of board games). We started with the edamame which was BOMB. Not that edamame is hard to mess up but it had this amazing seasoning on it. Then we both got the chicken tandoori skewers which were incredible. The dipping sauce was great. For entrée I got the vegetable ramen and he got the chicken rice bowl. The ramen noodles were some of the best I've ever had. I ended up actually having to share my bowl with my husband he loved them so much. I liked his chicken bowl but he wasn't a big fan because he said the chicken was too chewy (I thought it was fine). We finished off with a glass of sake!!"

Unfortunately, tonight I chose delivery and ordered the Carnivore Ramen. When it was delivered, everything was there, but the contents were far below what I expected in quality. The noodles definitely did not appear the Ohio City Ramen that was promised on the menu, but appeared to be just grocery store spaghetti. All of this aside, the ramen was still poorer quality than I would have expected. The flavor and the contents were nothing special, and this will not jump to mind as a place to go for ramen in the future. Portion was a lot smaller than I would have imagined for the price.

I'll probably give this place another chance when I have the time to go in person, but first impressions do not have me excited to return for the food."

When walking in the dining room it  was full and so was the bar besides two seats. The menu had alot of interesting drinks and creative names. Will have to try the next time if i come back! As for the food my boyfriend and I were not too impressed. We tried a few different types of skewers. ( Chicken/Fried chicken/and some other one i forgot) plus the yuzu fries.The skewers were honestly nothing crazy and Im pretty sure we finished them in less than 5 mins they were pretty small. They werent expensive just not filling at all. So i guess they are good for a snack?  The yuzu fries on the other hand, I would come back for. The sauce on them was sooooo good.

However, food was something other than crave-able upon leaving. Had the chicken skewer which was just that, chicken on a stick. Not too bad. The real disappointment was the chicken teriyaki bowl. The sauce was so salty you made that ""face"" when taking a bite. So so so over powerful. Salt doesn't bother me but this was drastic overkill. I tried to mix in the rice to dilute anything I could but I really couldn't. Both me and my girlfriend left half our bowls. I would go back and try something different but not anytime soon."

The bar was fairly crowded so my friend and I grabbed a seat in the dining space where there was ample seating.  First and foremost, the beer and cocktail menu is not only beautifully curated, but hilarious and witty with on-trend references like the 3am Snap Story cocktail.  I had a Platform Xmas ale which was one of the best Christmas ales I've tried.  

 As far as the food goes... I was able to try the food at a previous Yelp event and I'm drooling over the fries right now. They offer tasty, unique bites that they serve until late which is a nice option over the usual 24-hour diner fare.  Staff is friendly and accommodating. 
Additionally, they are always hosting clever events like The Oregon Trail bar crawl.

While I was there, some guy at the bar bought the whole house of 20+ people a round of shots. That's the kind of place Yuzu is.  
It's warm, it's friendly, it's unpretentious.  It's your new Cheers. 
Grab a friend and go here for a great beer or cocktail, conversation and some tasty late night bites. You won't be disappointed."

The atmosphere is laid back. The outdoor patio is awesome.  Nice view of the sky (sunset) and some trees for shading. Dogs welcome!!

The wait staff was very efficient and super nice.  Down to earth. Attentive. 

Our food was delicious.  Wasabi fires very tasty, not super hot - so don't be scared off.
Edamame beans?  I think that's what they were called. So very good and natural. Just the
right dusting of salt and spice. 
Skewered chicken and rice with roasted vegetables. Again, a wonderful blend of taste. 

I just stuck with the local beers.  But they had a list, I'll check out next time.  

Overall, it is not overly priced. Too many spots in Lakewood are getting hoyty-toyty and upper - crusted over. Know what I mean?  We just want a nice place to hang out with good food that isn't always typical bar food. And decent beer prices with a choice if we want something better than average.

Food was really good -- the bowls tasted like homemade cooking--in a good way, meaning healthy, tasty, satisfying, and homey--but all with an inventive twist. I really appreciate having not one but two vegan options -- and they were very accommodating, even bringing out an extra side of fries when we realized the (delicious!) sauce on the fries might not be vegan. And speaking of the fries -- they were so good! VERY hot which is just how you want fries to come out.

After placing our order, the drinks and appetizer (yuzu fries!) came quickly. The entrees (vegan Buddha bowl, Bourbon chicken bowl) came out about halfway through the appetizer; perfect timing imho. Our server was pleasant and attentive, yet not over the top. 

One thing I think would make this place a little better, is if tofu/seitan/tempeh was available as a protein for vegan/vegetarian dishes. But overall, this place was great!

So, if you are into late 90s-early 2000s punk music and yummy rice bowls, this is the place for you."

The atmosphere is fun (punny cocktail names galor) but also a little strange. Despite being very obviously Japanese-inspired (decor, origami instructions on the coasters, descriptions of Japanese terms on the menu), the staff responded as if offended when my friend asked for chopsticks with her teriyaki rice bowl. 

My yakitori was tasty, but despite getting two different skewers, they tasted very much the same. So much so I'm a little convinced that they mis-made my order. I was also missing any hint of potato with my fried chicken skewer (a misnomer, since both of my skewers where fried chicken), despite it being in the description. My vegetable skewer (which was actually still chicken?) came with the same small side of veggies as the fried chicken skewer.

The portions are also extremely small. Despite spending over $7 on my 2 skewers, I left Yuzu pretty hungry."

I had the chicken skewers, Yuzu fries and beef bowl. All A+

The size and price of the food is like tapas. Two or three skewers, bowl and app make a great meal. Some ""tapas"" restaurants have huge portions and steep prices - yuzu's are just right . Here the orders are perfect to share a few bites. 

Even though it is a new restaurant the service and flow were excellent. All the service staff were friendly and welcoming.

Now for another secret if you've made it this far in the review. The backyard patio is a secluded hideaway. Maybe six tables surrounded by a high fence and pine trees. Lakewood doesn't have enough outdoor dining options and Yuzu has one of the best."

The cocktails and shot combos are pretty out there in terms of ingredients and flavor combinations (cinnamon and tomato water!?) but somehow they work. Not what I'd normally be looking for but interesting / fun to try. Order an amaretto sour made with their house ""triple citrus yuzu juice"" instead of sour mix, it's pretty delish (they should definitely add that to the menu). If all of this sounds good to you and you're not really interested in ordering food, stop reading now and go have a solid evening of drinks at a quirky, fun twist on a local dive.

The food at Yuzu is just terrible. Rice bowls, skewers, and appetizers are all on the small size for the price - $6 for fries, $3 for a skewer with three tiny chunks of chicken on it, etc. The bigger problem is that the food just doesn't taste good. The rice has been gummy - almost to a paste-like consistency - on all three occasions we've tried it. The ""cheater"" bulgogi bowl seemed to just be ground beef cooked with soy sauce, and the chicken teriyaki (the ""food court favorite"") was a meager handful of chicken pieces tossed in a sauce that can only have been made by boiling pure soy sauce down until it's thick enough to coat the chicken as a glaze - it was WAY too salty to eat. It would be way better (i.e. edible) if they just used an industrial-sized jug of foodservice teriyaki sauce. The mall food court is much better sadly, and you get much more for your money.

I really wish the food was even remotely decent, because their concept is fun and unique, and I think I could otherwise have make it a regular late-night haunt."

Was excited to try some newly introduced Cleveland-area ramen, but the Herbivore ""ramen"" was a horrifying $7 joke of a meal. A clump of something-noodles in a cereal bowl of pure Kikkoman soy sauce and 5 chunks of assorted mixed vegetables? Who are you kidding, Yuzu?

In fairness, I've only tried two dishes, both five dollar specials. This is a great deal, maybe even a steal for the amount of food you receive.

I tried the gluten free veggie ramen. The noddles were tasty, not overdone. The egg complemented the broth and vegetables, and it warmed me up on a cold night.

The ramen (herbivore ramen) was bland. I requested no egg and they included it anyway. I don't think they put nearly enough flavor in the ramen. I wouldn't buy most of their food again outside of the fries, especially since they failed to not put the egg in which ruined the meal.

If I got this ramen in the restaurant and not delivered I would have sent it back. I don't want to eat it because it's so bland. Don't get the ramen. Just get the fries."

An izakaya isn't merely a bar serving Japanese food, as there are many bars in Japan that serve food and aren't considered izakayas. An izakaya is more akin to a Japanese TAPAS bar, which has a wide variety of appetizers and small bites to choose from. Yuzu has a small sampling of appetizers, but the menu items are mostly standard and so I'd consider it more just an Asian fusion bar.

The atmosphere was nice, and the staff were very friendly and accommodating. The food was ok - my friend got the Korean beef rice bowl, which the menu admits to using ""cheater"" bulgogi. The beef was ground up, whereas bulgogi is more in thin slices. The flavor was not too bad, though it was the type of dish I could get at almost any restaurant. 

I personally got the ahi tuna poke, because poke has been on the rise in the States and I have been trying to sample poke everywhere. While the colors and presentation were solid, the flavor was not to par. The tuna was very tough to chew and did not taste particularly fresh. When I have poke, I typically anticipate that the tuna has been marinated in various sauces for a fairly long time, but this dish tasted like the sauce was recently added on. I also felt like there was not enough sauce in general. Additionally, the mangoes and avocado seemed to stand in contrast to the fish rather than complement it.

I do enjoy the atmosphere at Yuzu, and the staff were extraordinarily friendly. However, I think the food could use some work in terms of flavor."

I have also tried the yuzu fries, which were definitely not what I expected, but so delicious. The patio is small, but a nice place to sit when the weather is nice enough. They also have a nice selection of board games if you need a little something different to spice up your night!

First off, I really wanted to like the place.  I love the concept and I was expecting to be wowed by my experience.  However, I was really underwhelmed.  We started off with the Yuzu fries which were actually really yummy-the wasabi sauce on top was the shining star.  For our second course, we were able to order two items from their Yakitori menu.  We went with the Top Sirloin Tips and Tandoori Chicken.  The meats were cooked well, but the vegetables it came with seemed like an afterthought and was just thrown there to fill up space.  The sauces they came with were ok, but we preferred to eat our meats without the sauce.  Third course, we chose 2 Bowls- Korean Beef & Little India.  The beef in the Korean Bowl was really tasty, however it could use more ingredients.  It was literally just rice, beef, sriracha and a scattering of green onions- maybe an addition of carrots, bean sprouts and spinach would be nice with some gochujang sauce.  Little India was just bland.  All the ingredients seemed to be mashed together and it just looked so sad.  I really appreciated the effort on doing something new in the area and service was friendly.  I'll definitely come back for cocktails and yuzu fries!"

The idea is fantastic, the menu sounded awesome, the reviews were in general great. After a failed attempt at getting into Barroco, I remembered that I had seen great reviews for this place online and convinced my friends to give it a try.

We get in and the atmosphere was nice. It seemed laid-back, the waitresses and bartender were extremely nice and provided great service, and the seating area was well.. Ehh.. I don't know. Let me just say a little about the food.

I got a Korean Beef Bowl. I've had Korean beef from a Korean family. What I ate was not a Korean Beef Bowl. It was ground beef, sriracha, and rice. I'll give it to 'em though-- the rice was cooked well, and the beef had a good spice to it. It wasn't terrible, just not as flavorful as I had anticipated.. I enjoy rice.. I enjoy beef.. I enjoy Sriracha.. But I don't know.. It just wasn't quite up to par with anything I've had elsewhere. I also had a mixed drink.. It wasn't special, but it was good enough to get a buzz going. I again expected more flavor than was present. 

My friend got the Moroccan bowl.. It was rice, egg, some avocado, and a canned Mexican red salsa? He claims there was nothing Moroccan about it.. I'll take his word on it.

Now for the grand finale: my last friend got the Beef Ramen... Yeah... Ramen.. We immediately suspected that something had gone awry when they brought out a very tiny bowl.. Too tiny to house the typical ratio of broth to noodle that one would expect from a ramen dish. The beef was.. Well.. The same ground beef that was in my Korean beef bowl. The noodles.. Let's be honest, this was pretty much noodles with broth as an afterthought. 
I remember the look on his face when he took the first bite.. He looked like he was in pain. I had asked him if it was all right and he didn't even bother trying to lie. When he had finally given up and pushed the bowl to the side, I decided to try my mouth at this dish to see if it was as bad as he claimed.. It tasted like gravy with a consistency to match. The noodles were not fully cooked, but were mushy on the outside, almost as if they had been left sitting in cold water all night.. Fortunately the drink had put me in a good mood so we all got a nice laugh out of it.

My final verdict: 
Idea: 10/10
Execution: 4/10

The dishes are all great in theory, but the flavors need reworked. Definitely not too happy about the money that was spent. Sorry guys."

I ended up ordering delivery through UberEats. First, it was quick. Took about 30-35 minutes, which is less than most pizza delivery. I ordered a Korean bulgogi bowl, Thai steak bowl, the Yuzu fries and a child's chicken teriyaki and pb&j skewer. My Thai bowl was REALLY good. There was a sufficient kick from the fresh ginger (but I'm a wimp when it comes to spice). I also tasted my husband's Korean bowl. It was really good, but, it didn't taste like any bulgogi I've ever had. Again, however, it was so good that I'd order it again. I tasted my kids' chicken teriyaki and I appreciated that it tasted like -real- chicken teriyaki. My kids generally eat kid sized portions of adult food so I love places that offer that. The prices are super reasonable. At first glance, the portion was small but I was satiated. I'll definitely return."

I love the tapas idea and they price the items accordingly. I got the bento box with fried cauliflower and veggie ramen. Bento box came out in a Styrofoam take out container which I thought was a bit odd. The ""dessert"" was chocolate chips, in a little plastic sauce container, also odd. Overall not bad, the Wasabi aoli was pretty good.

The ramen, overall, was pretty good. This actually came in a real bowl, but the bowl was pretty small. Would have been nice to have more soup, I mean that's the point of ramen right?? The noodles themselves were pretty reasonable cooked although not perfect. The flavor was pretty damn good, though beans in ramen was a little odd. 

My friend got one of the rice bowls, which was pretty good, although it did have a sort of odd flavor or spice to it.

The drinks were delicious though! Only good things to say there.

So I'll definitely be back, but won't hold my expectations very high. From reading other reviews, seems like the quality can be inconsistent. Not sure what's happening in their kitchen, but if they can get their consistency better then it has the potential to be great."

When pressed, he stated ""it would take hours and hours to balance"". That's when we knew we were in trouble. The second fan was installed in the adjacent office area by his employee at the end of the day. He rushed out so quickly we only noticed the dangerously wobbling fan after they'd left. Now we had 2 wobbling fans and to add insult, both fans were activated when either remote was pressed. They had neglected to change one of the codes prior to installing.  
We hired Alex instead of Lamps Plus as we had some other electrical issues. Later, over the phone, Lamps Plus told me the fans are balanced from the factory and would not require ""balancing"" if they are installed correctly, and no employee would ever leave the job with a fan wobbling.  Alex offered to return but having lost all confidence in his work we knew that having him back would only make things worse. We decided to hire a professional fan installer (Lamps Plus) and asked Alex for a refund for the cost to have the fans re-installed ($95 a fan). ALEX DID NOT REFUND US, but we are relieved with our choice and this is why:

Lamps Plus technicians came and took the fans down, then reinstalled them with no balancing issues. What they did find was rather disturbing:
THE REMOTES: 
* Alex neglected to re-code one remote prior to install so both fans were turning off and on when either remote was pushed. This would have been taken care of by a professional who regularly installs fans.
OFFICE FAN (we had a can light changed to a fan):
* The ground wire was not stripped and connected. A serious omission.
* Alex supplied a decorative medallion with an indent to cover the can light hole. It needed to be flush, as such they only used 2 of the 4 screws to secure the fan cover since the other two would not fit.  
* The light kit was loose, it was not screwed down and was also missing a nut. This alone would make the fan wobble.

BEDROOM FAN:
* The canopy screw was not used (missing).
* The screws from the rod to motor were not tightened.
* The wiring was not done correctly to the receiver.
* The junction box had to be replaced since Alex used 2 different wood screws on the metal junction box.  One screw was secure, but the other fell out when it was being taken down.

The fans were wobbling due to missing screws, using incorrect screws & parts not being screwed down securely. During our back and forth, Alex kept bringing up a GFI he had offered to install for free and all the discounts. I don't know about any ""discounts"" as they were not pointed out to me. We hired Alex because he had good reviews and he assured us when he came by for the estimate that he was capable of the work. No ""discount"" makes up for work that is done so incorrectly that a fan could fall from the ceiling, short out and/or catch fire or have to be re-installed. Lamps Plus took less than 2 hours and we now have a 2 year guarantee.  They did the job that should have been done the first time."
798,1Jp_hmPNUZArNqzpbm7B0g,Las Vegas,Task Electric,-115.269332,36.056382,89113,aKpyW3LlXK2alPr2whaGEg,E3j0SXUayGKcKYzKmAoqrQ,"I needed an electrician to run lines to the ceilings in two bedrooms (and put up ceiling light fixtures), and to hang a ceiling fan in the master bedroom (the electric lines were already there, but no fixture).  In addition, there was a hanging light in the family room that was in a very poor spot and hung much too low.  I wanted someone who could remove that light and put up a ceiling fan in the center of the room.  In addition, there were 5 outlets which were controlled by light switches that I wanted to have converted to outlets that were always on.

I called a number of electricians in the Las Vegas area, including Task Electric.  Alex sent me a message saying that he wanted to come out and see the house and discuss the work in person so he would have a full understanding of what I wanted to be done.  I liked that as we would both have a full understanding of the work and the cost for it.

It was important to me to get the work done quickly, and Alex said he could get the job done that same week.  His crew was scheduled to be at my house at 8:00 am two days later, and they arrived about 10 minutes early.  That was another thing that impressed me about this company as they made sure they were on time.  And coming early is always a good thing in my opinion.

We walked through the house and discussed exactly what work was to be done (to make sure there was no confusion).  Alex arrived shortly thereafter to make sure that his crew knew what to do and to let me know that if I should have any questions or concerns while the crew was there, I could call him (he was scheduled for a different job that day).  It said a lot about him that he came to my house to make sure everyone was on the same page about the work, especially since he had arranged their schedules so they could get the job done right away.

The crew did a great job.  They started with the family room and were able to center the ceiling fan so that the lights would illuminate the entire room.  This process required them running electrical lines to the new placement and then removing the old light and capping the previous hole in the ceiling where it hung.  I also wanted the ceiling fan to be wired to a double switchplate where one switch would control the light and the other would control the fan (I wanted to be able to turn either on without having both on). 

They hung the same type of ceiling fan in the master bedroom and wired it the same way as in the family room (double switchplate with one switch working the light and the other working the fan).  

After that, they moved on to the two smaller bedrooms.  Those rooms were somewhat of a challenge as there were no electrical lines running to the ceiling in them, and they had to run the lines to the switch on the wall and the middle of the ceiling.  That involved them going into the attic to get the wires where they needed to be.  

Everything went well, but there was an issue with the ceiling fan in the family room.  When the fan was on low or medium speeds, it worked great.  But when it was turned on to high, the fixture started shaking a lot.  I was very concerned about that, and the crew double checked that it was mounted correctly and that everything was as tight as could be.  The electrician explained that sometimes the fan motors are not balanced correctly and that he felt this was what was happening in this instance.  He also said that the store where I bought the fans (Home Depot) would exchange the one that wasn't working properly.  He also said that they could come back when I got another fan and put it up for me (and take down the old one).

I was very concerned that I would have to pay for another fan to be installed, but when I called Alex to discuss the situation, he said that when I got another fan, they would take the old one down and put the new one up free of charge.  I was extremely impressed with this as it wasn't an issue with how the fan was installed by his crew, but rather it was an issue with a defective fan being purchased at Home Depot.

Today his crew came back and took down the bad fan and installed the new one.  In addition to taking the old one down, they also took it apart so it could be put back into the box it was purchased in, and could be returned to the store.

It says a lot about this company that they do the little things that their customers appreciate.  It would have been a difficult for me to take everything apart by myself and they were able to do that for me.  In my experience, a lot of companies don't go the extra mile like Task did.

In addition, when they were done with the work when they originally did the job and again today when they came back, they did an excellent job cleaning all of the places where they did work. 

Obviously I recommend this company very highly, and would not hesitate to use them again for any electrical needs in the future.  In addition, I have recommended them to a number of people and will continue to do so."

He works clean and doesn't leave a mess. He comes running on short notice when an emergency situation arises but never schedules more than a couple days out for non-emergency jobs. I was in a situation recently where I had to work with another electrician and I just couldn't believe the difference. By comparison the other guy was over priced, rude, sloppy, careless, and flat out lied to me. It isn't easy to find quality service providers in Las Vegas but Alex and Task Electric are hidden jewels in the desert. If you call anyone else you'll get less than you pay for and a lot of wasted time and frustration. Call Task and the job will go smoothly and you won't get ripped off. I swear I will never use anyone else again for any electrical work I need anywhere."

The quote was very affordable and scheduling a date was fast & very convenient. I received 2 other bids from others and they seem to be somewhat shady with quoting an estimate. Alex was straight to the point. Then when I was ready to install my pendant chandelier Sam completed the job. He did an amazing job. I didn't have pre-wire on my ceiling so I was concern about how it could be done. No holes in my wall. The other contractors were saying they might have to puncture 3-5 holes in my wall. Sam only made one hole which was for my lighting. I was so amazed & very satisfied with his work. They offer lifetime warranty on their work. I will definitely use Task Electric again. Thank you so much Alex & Sam :) I'm a very happy customer!!

The TCBY recently opened on Saturday and are cranking out the usual frozen yogurt bar with all the fixins. While I can't compare it to Red Mango (since I never went), I can say that this TCBY was quite impressive.

The interior is super bright and clean, most probably since the store just opened. There are a few interior tables as well as two outside that were pretty comfortable. The guy behind the counter was nice and gave my sister a few tasting cups so she could try the flavors before deciding what to plop into her bowl. They had a about ten flavors to choose from, and I really enjoyed the bananas foster. What was really cool was they had a cookies & cream flavor next to a salted caramel, so you were able to twist the two together. A salty, caramely cookies & cream was an amazing flavor combination!

Of course, when I look at these yogurt bars I look to the toppings, and I was impressed with the selection that this TCBY had. There were a lot of fresh fruit options, and that's what I like. I loaded up on mangos, peaches, strawberries, kiwis and blueberries, and left behind the pineapple, orange and some other stuff. They did have the jelly-like bobas that are weird to me. I was introduced to mochi, which is a rice thingy that is very similar to marshmallow, and will now become a staple on all of my future frozen yogurt concoctions. There was also plenty of the ""junk food"" toppings like chocolate chips, syrups, candies and other stuff.

The price seemed about right, as our two frozen yogurt bowls came out to $7 and change. With a appealing interior and awesome topping selection, I see us coming back here."

First we were greeted by the most unhappy hostess. Next, we asked the bartender if there were any happy hour specials and all he said was they has no good specials. He never told us what they were.  My friend ordered spaghetti with meat sauce and I ordered manicotti. To say his spaghetti needed more sauce was an understatement. We literally counted about four pieces of meat in the entire dish. He had to ask three different people for extra sauce before he actually got any. For $13, I got two tubes of manicotti. I honestly mean this and I'm not trying to disparage the place but I could've bought frozen manicotti and dumped ragu on it and it would have tasted just as good. And $5.35 for a draft Peroni is too much. I think boxed spaghetti with Ragu would've been better than what my friend had. It's a shame because I used to really like this place.  But that will be my last visit. We overheard the waitress at the table next to us tell them they could not order pizza because it was only able to be taken out not eaten in.

Good news first: the blackberry sangria is excellent.  I do prefer my drinks on the sweet side, and it tasted like candy.  

However, the rest of the food was very blah.  We ordered the bruschetta to share, but I'm not sure what we really got.  Cheese (I'm guessing a goat cheese ricotta) balls sitting in warm marinara sauce with sliced garlic bread on the side...since when is this bruschetta?  It wasn't bad, per se, but my tablemates and I were quite confused, to say the least.

Entrees were uneventful.  Lobster pasta special was bland, Pasta Weesie was greasy, etc etc.

This is like a Maggiano's, but on a smaller scale. The hostess was nice and friendly upon walking in.  Be warned that the place is small and does not fit a party of 8 easily.  We had to wait for half an hour for an early Friday dinner and it wouldn't have been so bad had they not told us it was only going to take 10 min.  Anyway, got past that and got seated.  We ordered and ate family style:  Linguine Pescatore, Spaghetti, Pasta Carrabba, Lobster Ravioli, Seafood Cannelloni, Italian Chicken, and Calamari.  We wanted to order the Antipasti Plate and thought we did but the waiter, brought out a sampler appetizer dish instead. This leads me to my complaint:  we saw our waiter 3 times AT MOST.  It didn't look terribly busy that night but we never saw him.  He was pleasant when we did see him but that was rare.  We had to ask someone else for water refills and were constantly looking for our waiter.  It was quite odd.  We would have corrected the wrong appetizer dish but we were afraid we would never eat if we never saw him and ended up waiting longer for our food.  The owner of this establishment should be aware that the servers are not attentive and it's a darn shame!

Onto the food:  The Linguine Pescatore was boring and didn't have much flavor, Spaghetti tasted like something from a jar, Calamari was WAY to salty (even the marinara sauce couldn't compensate), Pasta Carrabba was not memorable, Lobster Ravioli was done well with good/rich flavor in an orange sauce, Seafood Cannelloni wonderfully creamy filling but a small portion, and the pizza was dry.  Overall, Carrabbas was not a good place for a meal.  The prices are about right from a place like this ($12 -$18 a dish) and the atmosphere is decent.

I do not understand the poor reviews of this place.  Good service, hot good food, relaxing time.

OK, now for the meat of it. No pun intended.

I arrived a tad late in the evening.  Fairly busy.  I asked for a table because I don't do booths.  I just don't.  The only tables they had were pulled together.  The hostess went out of their way to pull a table loose and set it up for me.

I was quickly attended to by the server, Megan.  Top notch. I already had my choice made, a nice penne dish with the Italian salad.  The salad showed up about the same time my water did, which was very fast.

Meagan brought me a couple of wine samples and I picked a nice cabernet.

The penne came out at just the right time, piping hot and fresh. Megan made sure my water never went dry.  She was very attentive.

When I finished the penne Megan gave me a run down of the deserts.  I had the seasonal panna cotta, cooked custard with raspberries.

OK, I get it.  Chains are not always cool.  I much prefer local eateries, and the occasional dive.  But I like Carrabbas.  Their food is prepared the way I prepare things at home.

Megan did an excellent job.  If you have the opportunity to go to Carrabas be sure and ask for her and tell her Bud recommended her."

I looked up and the duct work was leaking! There was water all over the exposed duct work in the ceiling and it was leaking on floor! Gross imagine if that landed in my food or on me. 

Now about the food. First it was way over priced. Each item is sold separately. I looked at the drink menu and almost fell over. A cocktail is on average $8. I ordered the 5 cheese melt (sounds yummy right? WRONG) When the sandwich came to the table it looked horrible! Just a large mound of cheese on tiny bread. When I opened the sandwich the inner layers of cheese weren't even melted. I took a bite (thinking it was going to clog my arteries the whole time) and it didn't even have any flavor! A grilled cheese I make at home tastes better. I didn't even finish a half of a half and the waitress never even acknowledge that I didn't even touch my meal. 

I will never go here again. Moral of the story... overpriced, gross food and who knows whats dropping into the food as it's being walked around the room."

A few comments from my first (and last) visit to your restaurant: My girlfriend and I stopped on 05/12 around 4:20 pm for what we thought was going to be happy hour and dinner. We walked into an empty location, but it was early so no big deal being the only people there. We were seated in the dining room (where I wiped crumbs and food off the booth before I sat down... server didn't notice or care) and I asked the server if they had a happy hour menu. She said ""happy hour specials are only available at the bar and if you sit outside"". Kind of a surprise, but I get the idea. She then asked ""do you want to hear the happy hour specials"" and my response was ""well since we aren't sitting outside what is the point?"" She didn't seem to get the joke, and told us the specials anyway. Those included some deals on draft beer, wine, and food, but then she said there wasn't any tap beer tonight so it would be bottles on special. We looked around at a completely empty dining room and commented that it seemed odd to be so rigid on a happy hour (that ended at 5 according to your site) when there wasn't a single other person inside or outside. We didn't come in for cheap drinks, and we actually joked on the drive over that it was so close to the end of happy hour that we were prepared to pay full price anyway. The whole attitude of the place didn't communicate that we were appreciated as customers, the server and the other 2 staff seemed to be prepping or something else, so we opted to leave. Reading the reviews on various online blogs and the media articles, we expected much better. The food may be great, but the service and ridiculous ""happy hour rules"" will keep me from coming back to find out. I can only imagine what the response would have been if I had ordered something and asked for a substitution. We actually went to another option down the road and were thrilled with the experience. Having been in the hospitality industry in an executive position, I realize that things happen. I am simply writing to tell the owner of my experience, and what my observations were. In a competitive world where there are at least 30 other food options within half a mile of yours, the rigid rules, the poor service added to a dirty restaurant adds up in the customer's buying decision... it certainly did factor in mine tonight. My $50 plus dollars spent at a competitor seemed more appreciated by them than at your place."

I would definitely recommend them for a private party for a large group (we had about 60 attendees).

The meat was cooked perfectly, and I like how they give you one big, thick burger instead of two small ones. The pretzel bun was also good, but could have been pretzel-ier.

I had the Arizona burger.  The bun was burnt stiff on one side and the burger, and while good in theory, was ok at best.  Definitely could have done better.  I just don't understand why these places try and get fancy and butcher an American classic.  I don't need a fancy bun, especially if it's burnt, and if you aren't going to season the meat, at least make up for it in other areas.  The fries and southwest sauce was pretty good though.

On another note, there was a cold seafood bar near the kitchen, so I'm not even sure what theme they are going for here.  I can get surf and turf somewhere else, not at a burger joint.

If I lived close, I would give it another try, but don't expect it to blow you away.  Just another trendy burger joint in my honest opinion."

The fresh handmade garlic bun is an awesome addition to any burger. I have zero complaints as far as food goes.  Food gets 4 stars. 

My issue with this place is the service, or lack there of. Upon arrival there were two other tables that were occupied. It still took 10 minutes to get a drink. 15-20 minutes after that we got to order food. The food arrived after a reasonable amount of time. I felt like I wanted to pay my bill at that time so we could leave in a timely manner and not be held bill captive.  Service gets 2 stars. 

I want this place to survive because it is a local business with great food. Service issue needs to be resolved to reflect the price point of food. There are a million places to go get a $12.00 entree and a $5.00 beer, give me a reason to want to spend my money here."

We have been to this restaurant sporadically after our review in 2013.  Unfortunately, we will not be returning.  The food wasn't that bad, but the service and drinks were horrible.  The restaurant was only about 20% full, and it seemed fully staffed -- there was no excuse for the poor service.  Drink order took about 10 minutes, and despite the 2 hours we were there, no one ever asked if we wanted another drink.  It took 37 minutes to get our appetizer.

The good: revamped Market Bistro space is attractive and the bar selection solid. The burgers were very good and the garlic knots they're served on, equally delicious. The portions were fair - that is not overly generous or skimpy - and the food was fresh. Service was prompt and hostesses polite. Owner came through twice to ask about our experience. Prices are okay. 

The not so good: We were put at a table that did not have proper clearance between us and the next table on one side and a booth on the other. It meant that a large woman's stomach met my back as she passed through. Mmmm blech. Wait staff frequently hit the chair. I moved to the other side which meant that no one could get through there but it moved traffic around the two tables. Music, although nice, was too loud. 

For the number of families we saw in there, this does not read as kid friendly. I have a 10 year old for whom we ordered sliders without the peppers and chipotle mayo and although we could've sprung for a milk shake [hello more sugar] water was about my only other option and bonus! free. Now, I'm not expecting the crayon greeting that we get at CPK, but it just didn't have the family vibe to me. Kiddo liked the burger and the brownie dessert [which came as described on the menu but without the whipped cream] and the lovely seconded the dessert thumbs up. 

My flat iron salad had freshly cut romaine, homemade croutons, some bermuda onion, corn and black beans and a slice of tomato that was cut in half. I asked for the dressing on the side. It came with a good portion of sliced flatiron steak that although cooked well, had zero seasoning and the dressing on the side was described as a southwest caesar. I didn't get southwest and I did get blah/lacking in flavor. 

Bottom line, we'd go back but for the burgers only. Cost of the meal for three of us with no drinks, only water, was $40. Its nice that its in the hood and that there is good food but overall it was good, not great."

I think if mostly all you do is burgers they should be cooked the way you asked for and we were the only table they were cooking for at the time. We ordered two burgers and asked for one medium rare and the other medium. The medium rare one came out rare. The medium one came out medium well. So both of us were slightly disappointed but being one off we could manage and didn't want to waste time having one thrown back on. 

The burger I had seemed to be seasoned nice with a slight charr. About half the people are like me and will only eat half the roll because that's too much bread to eat. I thought the house made garlic knot was good and not too garlicky with the burger. (but I only ate the smaller half not the whole roll) But my companion eat the whole thing and said all together it was too much garlic so it can go either way.

The truffle string fries are OK but don't didn't taste truffles on our visit. Maybe they left it off or maybe they use real truffle oil that's very delicate? Usually if you taste a lot of truffle flavor it's artificial truffle aroma. So that may be a good thing that we didn't taste the truffle.

We both had margaritas and I'd pass on them them next time as they were large and too much mixer in proportion to booze.

Two burgers that came with the fries and two margaritas about $40.00 before tip."

We sat out front and waited for our waiter to take our drink orders... And waited... And waited.

Nearly 10 minutes after we were seated, I try to flag someone down through the front window, and finally our waitress arrived and took our orders. She apologized for the delay, said something about how she had to train someone to enter food orders. It didn't seem exceptionally busy, so I think they just forgot we were seated. I thought this might be an isolated incident, but then I watched another man with a small child get seated near us a half hour later and end up leaving before a waitress ever arrived because the child couldn't wait any longer to eat... I see from the reviews other people have had similar experiences. Maybe the wait staff they're training will improve the service here, but it wasn't great when we went.

The reason I am giving 3 stars is the food. The Carolina burger was delicious... The sauce and bacon were savory, the garlic knot bun was perfect. Their fries were great and they give you plenty of them.

We were seated for 10-15 minutes before anyone came over to our table.  Waitress was awkward and possibly on drugs (?!).  We got our appetizers 30 minutes after ordering.  When our entree eventually came, it was cooked incorrectly and was incomplete, missing sides of French fries for each burger.  

The owner came by our table several times making crass jokes and being offensive. The waitress unapologetically blamed the slow service on ""trivia night"" and only being staffed with two waitresses.  To top it off when we go to address our experience with management, the rude owner comes over and tells us to GET OUT, mocks our concerns, and asks us to never come back. NEVER have I felt more uncomfortable and offended than during my visit to Charr.

The food did take a while, but not too long for a real burger and there was one guy in the kitchen doing everything. I could see straight into the kitchen and saw the guy wash his hands. I appreciate his proper hygiene.

The food was very good and a good value at lunch menu prices.
One kid got the battered chicken fingers, she got a nice pile. The other kid plate came with 2 nice sized sliders and fries.

I went here for dinner on a Friday with a sorority sister because she had recommended it. It has a great location in morth Phoenix and hosts a beautiful fire pit fitted outisde patio, but was a little chilly for outside dining that night. We opted for a table in the middle of the place, my only complant was that I got the chair and my sister got the booth. In the chair, I felt like I was a foot above her and it was a little uncomfortable to sit that way.

None the less, the service was fantastic. We each ordered drinks and were hand delivered by a nice bartender. We could see the hustle and bustle of the kitchen from our seats and with an open air kitchen like that it really fills the room with the right amount of noise. We got an app, friend zucnini with ranch dipping sauce. They were alright. I wish they had a bigger crunch when you bite in but they also cut really nicely for nibbling perfection. 

I got the The Buffalo Chicken while my sister orded the Grilled Chicken. Mine came with the most melty, amazing, mouth watering white cheese. That was my favorite part. The bread was great and the chicken too. Not enough buffalo sauce but the blue cheese dipping sauce was on point.

From the hostess to the bartender to our waitress to Joe himself coming to chat with us, you feel like you are a regular at a restaurant that you've been going to for years. We were seated and ordered drinks, some alcoholic and some not, and all were good. The dirty Grey Goose martini was especially good. It's nice to find a place that will make it dirty when asked, instead of skimping on the olive juice. Always a plus for us is a strong, free wi-fi connection. Just ask your server for the password.

For our appetizers, our table had the tomato bisque soup, onion rings, and the red fresno pepper poppers. The soup was very creamy and thick, and the goat cheese was a great added flavor. The poppers brought some extreme heat to the table. These aren't your wimpy Sonic jalapeno poppers. The onion cream cheese filling cut the heat a bit with a nice tang, but be warned, these things pack a punch! As to the onion rings, I won't call them a ""miss"", but they were just so-so after the other two great offerings.

Various burgers were ordered along with some sandwiches. Everyone loved the obviously fresh-made garlic knot buns and fresh toppings. The sauteed crimini mushrooms and carmelized onions on my steak and blue sandwich were awesome. If you are a fan of the blue cheese, ask for extra. It was a little skimpy on my sandwich for my taste.

We were offered the desserts (made by Joe) including bread pudding and an apple crumble, but we were all too full to try those. Definitely next time."

The decor is smart and clean, if a little bland. It screams ""American Bistro"" in a cookie-cutter manner. The good things? They have a raw bar and do oyster shots (which I found reasonably priced, too)! Their bar is denfinitely well-stocked and they have a select list of wines and local/ micro-brew beers and ales (San Tan Ale was my choice that evening and it didn't disappoint), the shots were served cold (Patron) with lime, but no one remembered the salt until it was requested (quibble if you will, but I do like salt and lime with most commercial tequila). The quality of the ingredients of the food is quite good, too. Now the bad part: It took over 35 minutes for my order to come out (a burger and fries, an oyseter shot) and when one of the people at the table asked for HER check (not ""the check""), we got everyone's tab on it!

Frankly, ""Sir"" and ""Ma'am"" work really well). And the burger was NOT rare, but to be fair, you really can't get a patty that thin to be rare and warm. Oh, and ""truffle fries?"" Meh. Truffle oil doesn't impress me, but the texture was right, not overcooked or undercooked with a nice crisp outside. The beef was tasty, but the patty surprisingly thin, even for a $10.00 burger.
I'll go back, but I won't be in any hurry if I do and I'll ask for a different waitstaff if I get the same waiter. All in all, it seems like some of the staff could use a little more training in cadence and attentiveness but the food was pretty good.
Oh, and lastly, the bathrooms in a place that is trying to be upscale should be in good repair - broken tp holders and a large unpainted patch job isn't consistent with the image this restaurant wants to project."

Our burgers were fine, edible.  Fries are tasty, but I think they give you way too many, such that the fries spill on to the table, which is gross.  Why gross?  because this restaurant is just SHABBY.  It feels like nobody has any pride in this place. Our table was dusty and dirty, our booth was dusty, our apps plates were greasy...  Sad. 
Service was fine. Food was fine. I thought the fried pickle chips were the best part of the meal, actually.  Overpriced, though.  
I waited a very long time to try this place, and I have no plans on going back. Too bad, because I'm a fan of both of the other two Aiello restaurants in the same building."

They use black Angus beef, have turkey burgers that are huge, and a black bean based veggie burger too. Gluten free buns are an option. You can have fries with white truffle oil or homemade mac-n-cheese. A side salad or sweet potato fries are a buck more, and homemade onion rings are a couple of bucks more, but are yummy. They have two slider options for appetizers where the garlic knot bun's are homemade. The chili wings are tasty. They have great portion salad options in case a burger is not what your wanting. The shakes are a great compliment. They have a few desserts. I had the warmed brownie with vanilla bean ice cream, whipped cream and more chocolate syrup on top. Did I mention they have a full bar, and many craft beers on tap. So many choices I did not list."

Both times have sat on the dog friendly patio. I've had a different waitress each visit however, they both seemed so uninterested in being at work. Also the yelp hours listed never seem to match what they're open. Last time as we were leaving another couple showed up thinking they were open till 10 weekdays. 

Here's the saddest part, I love the location and the menu. But the wait staff is so unwelcoming it's amazing. First visit ( we think they're open till 10(yelp listed) we show up at 8:15. At 8:45 while eating our entrees the waitress turns off the fire and starts closing down. Ok ok we're done can we have a box?  Tonight our waitress had three tables (all outside) we ordered a salad and an appetizer and twenty minutes later they show up with our entree right behind when we ordered them at least 10 minutes apart. Our waitress spent the majority of her time in at the bar with the other staff eating pasta from a to go container from somewhere. 

Ok also don't order the veggie burger. I know I know it's a meat place, but I was trying to make a healthy option tonight. Tasted like when I tried a Pinterest fail recipe. Just get a burger."

I sat for a very long while before I got her attention to order their wings. The bartender made fun of me when I ordered them, she was laughing and mocking me saying ""this girl says she wants some wings"". They came out and were covered in way too much sauce.

They have a nice selection of beer on tap and a full bar. Salads are maybe a bit run of the mill.

As Charr is near where we live and restaurant choices are not very good, we gave this try on a Wednesday night. 
Easy parking.  Great ambiance.  Nice patio with a fire pit.  Got seated promptly.  Good start.  Water came.  Weren't familiar with the menu so we didn't order immediately. 
Took a long time for the server to come back.  My water glass was empty again. We ordered a burger with avocado extra ($1).  Our menus were different and it wasn't clear that fries came with your order. It does in most places.  Ordered a flat-iron steak sandwich with bleu cheese---very good.  Enough for two small appetites.  The burger was overdone; no avocado, and a dried out bun.  A pile of ""truffle"" fries were placed in the middle of the table.  No dipping sauce (most upscale places offer that).  Wait staff was scarce in an almost empty restaurant.  Had to leave the table and go into the restaurant from the patio to get a check.  Commented that I felt invisible.  The waiter chuckled (wrong emotion). He gave us a small discount.  One can run up a big check here when you add in drinks and side orders of fries. But the quality does not justify these prices.   We are very generous tippers when service is good.  Our tip:  $0.00.  Another tip: Avoid this place.

Finally, a friend shopping at the nearby Safeway ran into a customer buying truffle oil spray (an employee from Charr).  They spray the oil on the friends--voila truffle fries. 
Can't imagine this place surviving with service and practices like this to go with high prices."

The menu is packed full of great options, salads, burgers, sandwiches and sides. It really was a tough decision with all the great choices but  I went with the Belly Buster fork burger and my boyfriend had The Phoenix burger. Delicious. It hit the spot, cooked the way I wanted. Complete with that charred taste. They came on Garlic Knot Buns, just a hint or garlic taste if any. With these buns we noticed that they are a much hardier type of bun that won't become soggy after sitting as easily. Sturdy yet soft. Butter lettuce, tomato, and onion served on the side. When they say ""smothered"" they mean it.   We found a good Burger joint without having to treck across to downtown phoenix or scottsdale for an overpriced burger. No reason to go else where now :)"

Try the steakhouse burger.. A burger covered in a smoked gouda cheese and mushrooms, slightly smothered in a yummy steak sauce, and topped off with some crispy onion strings.

They were flatten when we were greeted by the hostess who was seated behind the podium. Not only was the hostess seated,but we had to ask to be seated outside. The hostess never offered inside or outside seating. 
Walking outside we noticed the many dirty tables, and the trash from previous customers littering the floor. In addition to the dirty tables, there was broken glass lying on top. The glass came from the lightbulbs above. So we moved inside. 
Once inside  we were seated near a server station where you could hear the servers and hostess cursing. In addition to the foul language I witnessed a sever chasing the hostess around the restaurant with a dead bug! 
I had ordered a beer on draft which was poured into a warm glass so with in minutes the beer was room temp and unpleasant. We both had burgers of course. I had ordered mine med rare and my girlfriend had ordered hers med well,both came out over and under cooked.

We will not be coming back. There were issues with every single course. 

The crab cakes were cold by the time they reached our table. My medium burger was cooked perfectly, but my wife's well done burger was cold. While the buns were delicious, the burger was slapped together like an afterthought. I had a dollop of BBQ sauce under my top bun and a puddle beneath it. The ice cream in our apple cobbler was clearly freezer burned.

To top it all off, the head chef was wandering around the restaurant, greeting guests and getting kind of touchy feely with people. He also had a conversation with a server about an unhappy customer within earshot of our table.

Look, I get that $33 for two people is on caliber with Chili's, but at least I remember Chili's consistently delivering HOT food -- even if said hot food tastes like hot garbage.

Joe finally came in, came to our table, and while assuring us that there would be no charge for our lunch had to ask what our order had been.  This is 50 minutes after we came in!  He was full of excuses and repeatedly asked us not to yelp him.  Sorry Joe but the public needs to know and you need to pay attention to the number of recent bad reviews. I ordered your Phoenix Burger and it was tasteless, maybe because it had to be cooked so quickly. You never even asked about why I didn't finish it in spite of standing next to me and seeing 3/4 of the burger sitting on my obviously finished with plate! Your waiter never, ever apologized to us.

That's the word that comes to mind when I think back on our visit to Char.  It was restaurant week and I can only assume that it was their first time participating judging by the fact that they ran out of half of the items on their menu.  The 3 things we wanted to order- guess what were out.  And the poor maybe a day over 16 year old waitress had no idea how to handle that.  We wanted the oysters, we were told they were out, so we said we take the chicken wings and guess what, they were out too!  So, of the appetizer choices we were forced into a crab cake.  This crab cake was mediocre at best. Crusty on the outside like a potato cake and mushy in the middle.  Gross.  We received potato pancakes with our meals that looked exactly like the crab cake- and just as disgusting.  When some older gentleman that I can only assume was an owner came by to check on us he noticed I had barely touched the potato cake.  When he asked me if I liked it, I began to respond with a ""not so much"" look on my face and he quickly ran off before I could even share my feedback with him.  This place needs to get it together. You obviously weren't ready for restaurant week or a serving food in general."

We moved in in December, and were optimistic that there were pizza/burger joints in walking distance. Upon trying the pizza, by our third visit/take out, we figured out that they have a one size fits all attitude that leaves much to be desired....bigger is not always better. It's a flavorless crust with greasier than necessary toppings. Then, we tried Charr, for burgers, since that's all they do, we were again hopeful that our burgers would be terrific. Such a pitiful excuse for a restaurant. First off, the server argued with my fiance about putting mustard on her turkey burger, and then neglected to honor my wish of medium for my burger. It was cooked all the way through, and the garlic knot bun is not a suitable vessel for the patty because it is too firm and crushed the toppings and it all squirts out. The service was so slow even though the place was almost empty during ""dinner rush."" The fries are really small, and too salty, sweet potato were also a disappointment. To top it off, this evening, my fiance was at home and could hear loud band/bad karaoke sounding music (which we have been hearing Thurs-Sat. since memorial wknd it seems) come blaring through our back yard starting 8pm. She traced it's origin to Charr, and asked to speak to the mgr. Joe Aiello (owner) fielded the complaint. He was a page out of Kitchen Nightmares, first arguing with her that as a business he didn't have to honor her request. When she suggested he turn it down or reposition the speakers, so as to keep the other possible neighborhood customers happy and returning, he insisted that as a bar that having this band as entertainment was beneficial. He called her rude for asking, and started to pressure her and intimidate her toward the door, trying to kick her out, he just cant take the criticism. This is not the kind of customer service you would expect to be given to someone who could bring in a lot of repeat sales. He is extremely unprofessional and it shows throughout his establishments. The food, service and ambiance in general is all sub par and reflective of his attitude toward guests and the Moon Valley community. NEGLIGENT! We highly recommend skipping this place, just head to McDonalds. We will not be back!"

Found out they had closed and decided to try the new Charr.  In a nut shell, overpriced and the food was OK at best (nothing you can't make at home with some basic store bought ingredients).  Ordered a ""glorified"" grilled cheese which literally was a hunk of cheese between two pieces of bread with no real flavor and my wife ordered a chicken sandwich that was dry and hard to eat.  The sandwiches didn't even come with fries (for $10 bucks each you can give your customer .50 cents in fries).  Ordered the cream cheese filled poppers which literally tasted like they came out of a freezer and where dropped old oil.  Defiantly not impressed and wouldn't go back."

I was with my father who lives in nearby Moon Valley. He was eager to try Charr after a neighbor recommended it. It was a complete failure. 

GOOD NEWS: burgers now come with side of  fries for the same price. 

BAD NEWS: The service was horrible. We just ordered burgers. I had the Carolina (with bbq sauce ON THE SIDE) he ordered the Phoenix burger. In only a few minutes our food was brought out by a someone from the kitchen. They asked, ""who had the Carolina?"" and set the plate in front of me when I responded and then gave the other burger to my father. 

My burger had BBQ on it (not on the side as I ordered) had it came on the side I would not have touched it. My fathers burger was just a plain cheese burger. We figured that we got someone else' order as it came out so fast. My father told the waitress about his lack of ""Phoenix"" in his burger and she went to the kitchen before I could get to my BBQ sauce issue or our theory of it being for a different table. Someone came from the kitchen and took the ""Phoenix"" burger away and came back 20-30 seconds later with roasted pepper on it and left. We got the waitress again to say that it still didn't have the chipotle mayo and she left immediately to get some despite me trying to tell her about the bbq burger I did not want. 

We told the waitress when she came back with the mayo that my burger had bbq on it and not on the side, but rather than having them recook my burger (they took my burger away but left my father to eat his) we just abandoned the meal. Also we never got flatware and/or napkins the entire time. 

Overall we spent 3 or 4 times longer trying to get our servers attention and get the order fixed (not including time it would take to fix mine had we stayed) than it took to get the food after we ordered. 

We are not picky eaters nor complainers. But they failed to do accommodate our one simple request (no bbq) and also simply forgot two components (the only two things that make it a ""Phoenix"" burger rather than a cheese burger) on another and made it a circus trying to fix them rather than just simply scrap the two burgers and remake them again correctly. 

The whole experience made me think that they just did not give a s**t. Little to no effort by the waitress and how can a kitchen claim they make great burgers if their solution to missing components it just to add them several minutes after they serve the food."

Looked at their menu to order crab cakes and pork tenderloin. I get a call to advise me they are out of pork tenderloin. So I order their ribs. I asked if everything else is okay and they said yes but told me the ribs cost $3 more (they could of waived that). Then 5 minutes later I get a call stating they are out of crab cakes. Again 5 minutes ago I asked if everything else was okay.  First it took over an hour for my food to get delivered Then I get my ribs (not even what I originally wanted ) and I would say I was and am very underwhelmed.

The Phoenix burger was in serious need of seasoning, as were the sweet potato fries. My husband tried the Cuban and while the garlic aioli was good (if you love garlic like I do), it was overpowering and the only thing you could taste.
Bar had no happy hour options and we were told it was because they hadn't put one together yet? Sorry excuse for spendy drinks, I think.

Now, that's not to say it wasn't a decent burger, but are there burger joints that do it better? You bet! Hop Doddys and Rehab Burger both in Scottsdale, I think cook a slightly better burger. That being said, why did I rate Char a 4? The service is what kicks this place up a notch. Everyone is so welcoming, including the owner who is from NY and walks the dining room asking his customers how their meal was. Oh, and the fries were pretty good too. The only downsides so far are the burgers and the hostess who walks around like she's on Xanax. I mean, come on, if you're going to hire a hostess then hire one who has a bit more pep and enthusiasm. Honestly, she looked positively bored."

The place definitely looked cool in person and it was well kept and clean.  The loo was pretty decent as well for a burger joint.  The staff were super friendly and helpful because this was our first time eating here.  Service was good speed, and no mistakes were made. 

To the food, Nicholas order their signature burger, and we split their mac and cheese... which was absolutely amazing! It's definitely not the best I had, but close enough.. and I highly recommend it.  I also order some wings which was okay, they were really tough to chew.

Being from the southwest Valley and rarely in that part of town, I had never heard of it, but I'm always willing to try out new places.

I arrived there at 5:30 on a weekday and there were only two people in there. That made me a little nervous, but the place looked nice on the inside and the bartender and hostess were very nice as well.

I ordered a bacon cheeseburger with fries and everything was delicious! The burger was cooked exactly how I ordered. The meat tasted fresh and high-quality. The goodies that come with the burger (lettuce, onions, tomato, etc.) looked fresh and tasty. The fries were equally delicious. They're the thin and crispy type and not greasy at all.

This little place pleasantly surprised me! If I'm ever in the neighborhood again, I will definitely go back to Charr. Nice staff, good service, reasonable prices, and great food. Can't really ask for more."

When our food arrived it was incorrect they forgot my bacon. The previously delicious garlic buns are now cold, dry and tasteless. Our fries were cold. We didn't have any silverware so we had to wait. We were asked if we would like mayo, we were like yes finally. We she brought the mayo, one little cup for our whole table, she basically dropped it off and left before we could even say anything else.

Sadly, it just all went wrong.  My wife and I just grabbed a spot at the bar early on a Friday afternoon.  Not too busy at all, early dinner and drinks.  Keep in mind, we are sitting right ""In the Middle of the Bar"".  Took us what seemed like 5+ mins to get our first drink.  Were then waiting another 5+ mins before we were asked if we would like to order food.  Ok, definitely could have flagged a bartender down for attention if I wanted, but for a first visit was just seeing how the service truly was.  So already, we are off to a bad start.

Our order was to split the Sliders on Mini Garlic Knots, the 5-cheese Melt and order of fries.

1) Sliders were dry and very overcooked.  Was missing the Chipotle mayo and the buns seemed not fresh and too dense with absolutely no Garlic flavor.  Sorry, if you are a burger joint and you put sliders on the menu, they better be damn good.

2) Five Cheese Melt was......incredibly flavorless.  We didn't even finish.  I was shocked.  5 cheeses an grilled sourdough!!!  How is it possible that it could be flavoress?  5 CHEESES! 

3) French Fries are the only reason it's not a 1 Star review.  They are really good.  Not the best ever or ground breaking, but still very crisp and delicious.  Their is no way in hell they are worth $6, but they are still good.

My wife and I promised we would give them one more shot and this time be more vocal if needed.  We really want Charr to work out but if the food and service remains the same, our next visit will sadly be our last."

The hamburgers are great and they have the best onion rings I've ever tasted. No complaints about the service.
Nonetheless, our meal tonight was very uncomfortable. The owner paid for our meal and told us not to come back. 
The hamburgers now automatically come with truffle fries, which is a step in the right direction as they are a bit pricey. My niece wanted to know if she could substitute sweet potato fries and pay a little extra. The waitress indicated that this was not their policy. However, she would ask the owner indicatiing he would not like it. The owner came to our table asking what was wrong. So my niece asked again. The owner indicated we were getting the fries for free. My husband indicated that he does not eat fries so they would be wasted. My niece said matter of factly, ""So you don't make exceptions."" She did not say it in an accusatory mannter. This is when the owner's friendliness turned to hostility. He said that we would get everything we wanted on the house and added, ""Don't come back."" 
Maybe the owner had had enough complaints for the day. I don't think we were obnoxious. We were not asking for anything for free. We would have accepted, ""sorry no exceptions. We wouldn't have liked it, but it wouldn't have stopped us from coming back as the hamburgers are that good. 
The restaurant refused to take our money even though we expected to pay. (Ironically we were using a Groupon.)
I don't have complaints about the food or service; in fact I have recommended Charr to others who liked it. I am not advising anyone not to patronize Charr. The food is great, but the owner overreacted. We live in Sunnyslope and like to support local businesses. However, the owner made it very clear that he did not want or need our business."

Went there today after several poor experiences in the past. Trying to give Charr one more chance.  No one greeted us for at least 10 minutes.  When the very tan, blond woman finally approached us, she was very kurt and I never did see a smile one her face.  We ordered drinks, which were delivered in a timely manner but when we were ready to order we found her to become very rude when I asked about customizing my meal.  When I finally conceded to her inflexibility she rudely snatched the menu out of my hand, with a nasty look on her face and stomped off in the direction of the computer to place our order.  At that point I decided we were through.  I expressed my feelings in what was probably an inappropriate way, left a few bucks to cover the cost of our drinks and headed for the door.  As we did, the server said, ""don't f**king f**k me!""

There are only 3 reasons to go out to eat in my opinion.  Good food, good ambience, good service.  Food has been good when I have eaten and the ambience is good but the poor service combined with ugly attitude makes this place a disaster...

Not a big fan of the industrial décor, but if the food is good I can live with it. Well - ugh!  A far cry from a burger joint, the menu was uninspired. We ordered the basic Charr burger -  one medium rare, the other medium well and got them cooked exactly the same. The garlic bun was intriguing but we both would have preferred them warmed a little. Ketchup served as the condiment of choice? I would prefer Thousand Island Dressing and maybe toss in a couple pickles. Neither of us had ever tasted Truffle fries, and I can honestly say I will never bother seeking them out. The muscle bound staff stood like guardians at the path to the restrooms. My friend braved the trail past them, announcing she had been in better restrooms in gas stations. I decided to skip the use of the facilities. I think a staff could at least ""fake"" busy so you don't feel like cattle being surveyed by prospective bidders at an auction. Charr is totally off the list of restaurants, and I wouldn't bother trying any of the sister restaurants. I can understand why people find their reservations available - it's because no one really goes there. Too many good burgers in town - I've learned to accept a $10.00 burger like I accept gasoline over $3.50 a galloon. The difference is, I have to buy gas - but I can get good food elsewhere for that $10.00.

I only wish I was in possession of one of their coupons they put out regularly. A painful experience is better with a coupon."

We were a little early for our reservation, so we sat at the bar. The bartender was really nice and lively. I ordered a cocktail off their menu and it was pretty good. 

When we sat down for our meal it took some time for our server to get to us. She came to us and asked if we had been helped since we already had drinks. I guess the hostess didn't inform her?  We ordered crab cakes for our appetizer, the portabella burger with truffle fries for me and steak with marsalla sauce with potato cake and asparagus for the boyfriend, and bread pudding with Bourbon blueberries for dinner. This is the reason I'm giving this place 3 stars: service was really slow! Another couple sat next to us after we were seated and they got their food before us. I'm not sure if it was because of the steak we ordered, but it was a long time until we got our main course. The actual food tasted good, but nothing to die for really. Also, their tap water tasted a bit off. Maybe it wasn't filtered? Eek..
Just like this rating, my experience at Charr was A-Ok."

The service was a little slow but the food was wonderful. We had the charr garlic chili glazed wings, easily in the top 3 wings of all time meaty, crispy, and the sauce was amazing, we actually had the waiter leave the plate of sauce so we could dip our fires in it. We had the Carolina BBQ Burger on a garlic knot instead of regular bun, which is a genius idea, and the truffle fries. We finished our meals with the apple crumb cobbler. Everything was amazing. Even though it was a far drive for us, we will be making the trek again just for those wings and burgers. Can't wait to try out the rest of their menu."

The burgers are ok if you order a medium. .. if you like rare or another way don't expect to receive it.

Service was very slow ... 2+ hours for dinner???? Also 1hr and 15min into waiting at our table we get told some of our order is not available.... go figure."

I'm shocked at the service critiques. We've been here a lot, and only once did we have mediocre service. Otherwise it's been terrific. I love the Buffalo Chicken sandwich, but really everything here is  excellent. I like the onion soup or the wedge salad for a starter. The burgers are tasty and too much to eat even for a big guy. The beer and wine selections have what I like. The atmosphere is just right. Not only that, but they will bring up Italian from their deli if you ask. What's not to like about Charr?"

The reviews here seem mixed so I had to check it out for myself. The first thing I noticed was the setup -- the multi-color backlit bar and the nice flat-screen LED tvs. I'm a big football fan so I will be sure to come by to eat and never miss a game! 

I came for dinner and was seated very quickly by the hostess. Menu had a wide selection of appetizers, salads, soups and drinks. Went for the charrburger with some custom toppings to my liking, beer on tap, and crab cakes to start. Some other reviews mentioned about price but having sampled other places in phoenix like Delux  I found the prices to be quite on par. More on what I think of the value later.

I got my crab cakes to start and they were excellent! Very moist, tasty and hit the spot. Next was my burger and it was quite a burger. The garlic knot bun turns out to be the differentiator between the other joints I ate at so I give charr the nod on the taste of the burgers. I thought the food was excellent and certainly of the best I have had.

Whether it is charr or the other burger places I sampled that serve high quality gourmet burgers, I think the price is very reasonable. This is not processed meat and the quality of the food, the ambiance where I can kick back and watch the games on the flat screen tvs and hang with my buddies makes it well worth the price. I dont plan on coming every night but at the end of a hard week of work it's nice to have a place to hang with both my buddies and colleagues for some drinks and/or food. If I want a cheap burger I can always get a big mac at the other end of the mall but I always regret it later when I choose fast food over quality.

Overall, I enjoyed my meal and the atmosphere and the service. I liked the other burger joints I have been trying as well but give the nudge to charr. I'd say try it out for yourself. Tip: waited at the bar for buddies to arrive afterwards for drinks and surprisingly found some cool outlets right under the bartop I could charge my pda while waiting. Very hard to find outlets to charge my phone while I am out so this was a nice bonus! They are kind of hidden under the counter so not sure this is well known!"

We will be back for more."

My date ordered the salmon salad.......no salmon. She had to substitute chicken. Really, no salmon on a the Friday night before Easter?  The turkey burger was over cooked and rubbery. The bun was stale and unedible. Absolutely zero flavor. What a waste of a Saturday night. As much as I like to support local mom and Pop's, I wont be able to support this one. PV burger Co, or Red Robin for me."

I thought we hit the jackpot with Charr American Burger Bar, sadly that was not the case. 
While the menu is interesting and I was very excited to see that they are  using homemade Garlic knots in lieu of the standard burger bun. We ordered the zucchini wedges and they were a true disappointment,  bland and overcooked.  My husband ordered the Phoenix burger and it was bland. I ordered the Carolina burger,  the burger was also not seasoned, the ""grilled chipolinni onions were ice cold as was the bun, the bacon was precooked (way too far in advance) and it was lukewarm.  The restaurant was not busy with only one person at the bar and one man having lunch, so I was not expecting such a mediocre meal and service.  
Truly dissatisfied & disappointed."

By FAR the best deal is the Hot Dog (Phoenix or Carolina style) for $6 which comes on the same huge pretzel bun as the burger and comes with excellent truffle fries.

The wedge ($6) is very small."

It took 20 minutes just to get our check after we were done eating and had already had to go boxes. Waitress was too interested in flirting with men at the bar then serving her customers. Would have given a lower rating but the food was good.  And we were the only people in the restaurant besides the man at the bar. Just hope you don't get the blonde tan woman who never actually gave us her name.

A burger place should be able to get that part right. My daughter's medium-well burger was cooked to the same burnt on the outside, dry as dirt inside consistency. Truffle fries were delicious hence the two stars."
